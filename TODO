NVT still seems buggy
check NVE working that it conserves energy- that means all the rest of the parts are working.

nate bets that on the first loop setting the accel vel and position on the thermostat on first loop not doing very well
Figure out if brute force rebuilding of cell lists is better than linked list maintenance
benchmark OMP (reductions?)
	don't really see a speed up for some reason
	PROFILE (-gp)

test if rebuld is actually faster (rs = 0)
maintain "real" positions for MSD calc (gr done automatically with vmd through snapshots)
add googletests
Add LJ potential

integrator verletStep is for NVE only now, add a class for this
change “start” to be local in each class for integrators

GPU
1. offload integration
2. then try offloading force calc (can use CPU cell list to build verlet lists for GPU)

Notes:
pbcDist2 much faster than pbcDist
cell lists much better than brute force for > 1000 atoms

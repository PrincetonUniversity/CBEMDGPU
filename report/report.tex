\section{Introduction}

Due to the dramatic increase in computing power over the last thirty years, computational chemistry simulations have become a remarkably fruitful tool for sciencetific discovery and engineering exploration.
%
Molecular simulations allow us to screen potential drug compounds \cite{...}, explore protein folding dynamics \cite{...}, and develop new catalysts \cite{...}.
%
However, most simulations that are physically relevant are on time and length scales that still require some degree of parallelization to be computationally tractible.

Our project focuses on implementing a parallel molecular dynamics simulation for Lennard-Jones particles.
%
Many of the standard force fields today are built on Lennard-Jones interactions.
%
For example, the TIP3P water model \cite{...} contains Lennard-Jones interactions and an additional electorstatic term to account for water's polariazibiliy.
%
In addition, Lennard-Jones particles serve as a very good model for monotomic gases such as Argon \cite{...}, crystals such as Iron \cite{...}, and condensed amporphous phases such as glasses \cite{...}.
%
We therefore chose to implement our software for only Lennard-Jones particles.
%
However, the code is sufficiently modular that other pair potentials can easily be incorporated in future versions.

Parallelization has also become essential for simulating molecular systems of interest. 
%
We have implemented our code to utilize GPUs or CPUs.

	evidence is presented here for the time constant for interconversion
	of disparate unfolded chain conformations of a small globular protein,
	cytochrome c, in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride denaturant.
	The axial binding reactions of histidine and methionine residues
	with the Fe(II) heme cofactor were monitored with time-resolved magnetic
	circular dichroism spectroscopy after photodissociation of the CO
	complexes of unfolded protein obtained from horse and tuna and from
	several histidine mutants of the horse protein. A kinetic model fitting
	both the reaction rate constants and spectra of the intermediates
	was used to obtain a quantitative estimate of the conformational
	diffusion time. The latter parameter was approximated as a first-order
	time constant for exchange between conformational subensembles presenting
	either a methionine or a histidine residue to the heme iron for facile
	binding. The mean diffusional time constant of the wild type and
	variants was 3 +/- 2 mus, close to the folding "speed limit". The
	implications of the relatively rapid conformational equilibration
	time observed are discussed in terms of the energy landscape and
	classical pathway time regimes of folding, for which the conformational
	diffusion time can be considered a pivot point.},

	fluorescence experiments indicate that while the overall binding

	destabilized relative to wild type (0.6 and 1.8 kcal/mol for H45Q
	and R44L, respectively). Both stopped-flow and pre-steady-state experiments
	suggest that the root of this effect may lie in multiple conformations
	for the E-NADPH complex of R44L. The ability of both mutants to transmit
	their effects beyond the local environment of the NADPH pocket is
	manifested in several details: (1) the pKa of Asp-27 (25 A away from
	the sites of mutation) is elevated from 6.5 in the wild type to 7.5

	than 45 s-1 in R44L; and (3) bound tetrahydrofolate decreases the
	affinity of the enzymes for NADPH as reflected in the Km from 2 to

  journal = {Computers \& Chemical Engineering},

  volume = {22},
  pages = {1159-1179},
  number = {9},
  abstract = {Part I of this paper (Adjiman et al., 1998a) described the theoretical
	foundations of a global optimization algorithm, the alpha BB algorithm,
	which can be used to solve problems belonging to the broad class
	of twice-differentiable NPLs. For any such problem, the ability to
	automatically generate progressively tighter convex lower bounding
	problems at each iteration guarantees the convergence of the branch-and-bound
	alpha BB algorithm to within epsilon of the global optimum solution.
	Several methods were presented for the construction of valid convex
	underestimators for general nonconvex functions. In this second part,
	the performance of the proposed algorithm and its alternative underestimators
	is studied through their application to a variety of problems. An
	implementation of the alpha BB is described and a number of rules
	for branching variable selection and variable bound updates are shown
	to enhance convergence rates. A user-friendly parser facilitates
	problem input and provides flexibility in the selection of an underestimating
	strategy. In addition, the package features both automatic differentiation
	and interval arithmetic capabilities. Making use of all the available
	options, the alpha BB algorithm successfully identifies the global
	optimum solution of small literature problems, of small and medium
	size chemical engineering problems in the areas of reactors network
	design, heat exchanger network design, reactor-separator network
	design, of generalized geometric programming problems for design
	and control, and of batch process design problems with uncertainty.

  abstract = {Aldehyde dehydrogenase from the bioluminescent bacterium, Vibrio harveyi,
	catalyses the oxidation of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes to acids.
	The enzyme is unique compared with other forms of aldehyde dehydrogenase
	in that it exhibits a very high specificity and affinity for the
	cofactor NADP(+). Structural studies of this enzyme and comparisons
	with other forms of aldehyde dehydrogenase provide the basis for
	understanding the molecular features that dictate these unique properties
	and will enhance our understanding of the mechanism of catalysis
	for this class of enzyme. The X-ray structure of aldehyde dehydrogenase
	from V. harveyi has been solved to 2.5-A resolution as a partial
	complex with the cofactor NADP(+) and to 2. 1-A resolution as a fully
	bound 'holo' complex. The cofactor preference exhibited by different
	forms of the enzyme is predominantly determined by the electrostatic
	environment surrounding the 2'-hydroxy or the 2'-phosphate groups
	of the adenosine ribose moiety of NAD(+) or NADP(+), respectively.
	In the NADP(+)-dependent structures the presence of a threonine and
	a lysine contribute to the cofactor specificity. In the V. harveyi
	enzyme an arginine residue (Arg-210) contributes to the high cofactor
	affinity through a pi stacking interaction with the adenine ring
	system of the cofactor. Further differences between the V. harveyi
	enzyme and other aldehyde dehydrogenases are seen in the active site,
	in particular a histidine residue which is structurally conserved
	with phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This
	may suggest an alternative mechanism for activation of the reactive
	cysteine residue for nucleophilic attack.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The greater prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome

	Two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of solutions
	containing sucrose, HFCS, or various ratios of glucose to fructose
	(G:F) on food intake (FI), average appetite (AA), blood glucose (BG),
	plasma insulin, ghrelin, and uric acid (UA) in men. DESIGN: Sugar
	solutions (300 kcal/300 mL) were (in %) G20:F80, HFCS 55 (G45:F55),
	sucrose, and G80:F20 (experiment 1, n = 12) and G20:F80, G35:F65,
	G50:F50, sucrose, and G80:F20 (experiment 2, n = 19). The controls
	were a sweet energy-free control (experiment 1) and water (both experiments).
	Solutions were provided in a repeated-measures design. AA, BG, and
	FI were measured in all subjects. Hormonal responses and UA were
	measured in 7 subjects in experiment 2. Measurements were taken from
	baseline to 75 min. FI was measured at 80 min. RESULTS: Sucrose and
	HFCS (experiment 1) and sucrose and G50:F50 (experiment 2) had similar
	effects on all dependent measures. All sugar solutions similarly
	reduced the AA area under the curve (AUC). FI and plasma UA concentrations
	were significantly (P < 0.05) lower after high-glucose solutions
	than after low-glucose solutions. The lower FI was associated with
	a greater BG AUC (P < 0.05) and smaller AA and ghrelin AUCs (P <
	0.01). Insulin and BG AUCs were positively associated (P < 0.001).
	CONCLUSION: Sucrose, HFCS, and G50:F50 solutions do not differ significantly
	in their short-term effects on subjective and physiologic measures
	of satiety, UA, and FI at a subsequent meal.},

	we turned to the yeast Pichia stipitis, which naturally produces

	initial configurations, and show that efficiency can be improved
	by stringently limiting the number of positions that are allowed
	to relax in response to a perturbation. The changes we describe improve
	the quality of solutions found for large-scale designs, and allow
	them to be found in hours rather than days. The improved FASTER algorithm
	finds low-energy solutions more efficiently than common optimization
	schemes based on the dead-end elimination theorem and Monte Carlo.
	These advances have prompted investigations into new methods for

	We have constructed a synthetic AND gate in the bacterium Escherichia
	coli that integrates information from two promoters as inputs and
	activates a promoter output only when both input promoters are transcriptionally
	active. The integration occurs via an interaction between an mRNA
	and tRNA. The first promoter controls the transcription of a T7 RNA
	polymerase gene with two internal amber stop codons blocking translation.
	The second promoter controls the amber suppressor tRNA supD. When
	both components are transcribed, T7 RNA polymerase is synthesized
	and this in turn activates a T7 promoter. Because inputs and outputs
	are promoters, the design is modular; that is, it can be reconnected
	to integrate different input signals and the output can be used to
	drive different cellular responses. We demonstrate this modularity
	by wiring the gate to integrate natural promoters (responding to
	Mg(2+) and AI-1) and using it to implement a phenotypic output (invasion
	of mammalian cells). A mathematical model of the transfer function
	is derived and parameterized using experimental data.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Homology models of proteins are of great interest for
	planning and analysing biological experiments when no experimental
	three-dimensional structures are available. Building homology models
	requires specialized programs and up-to-date sequence and structural
	databases. Integrating all required tools, programs and databases
	into a single web-based workspace facilitates access to homology
	modelling from a computer with web connection without the need of
	downloading and installing large program packages and databases.
	RESULTS: SWISS-MODEL workspace is a web-based integrated service
	dedicated to protein structure homology modelling. It assists and
	guides the user in building protein homology models at different
	levels of complexity. A personal working environment is provided
	for each user where several modelling projects can be carried out
	in parallel. Protein sequence and structure databases necessary for
	modelling are accessible from the workspace and are updated in regular
	intervals. Tools for template selection, model building and structure
	quality evaluation can be invoked from within the workspace. Workflow
	and usage of the workspace are illustrated by modelling human Cyclin
	A1 and human Transmembrane Protease 3. AVAILABILITY: The SWISS-MODEL
	workspace can be accessed freely at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/workspace/},

	for charge-transfer bands for complexes of charge +3, but has only
	a small effect on those for neutral or singly charged complexes.
	The energies of the weak d-to-d transitions of the Co complexes are
	systematically overestimated due to deficiencies of the density functionals.
	These errors are much smaller for the 4d metal complex. Taking these

	via an integer linear optimization model to output a rank-ordered
	list of PTMs that best match the experimental data. Each MS/MS spectrum
	is analyzed by a preprocessing algorithm to reduce spectral noise
	and label potential complimentary, offset, isotope, and multiply

	reorder the list of PTMs based on the cross-correlation between the

	address the universe of PTMs for every amino acid on the template

	is tested on several modified and unmodified data sets including
	chemically synthesized phosphopeptides, histone H3-(1â€“50) polypeptides,
	histone H3-(1â€“50) tryptic fragments, and peptides generated from
	proteins extracted from chromatin-enriched fractions. The data sets

	dissociation. The capability of PILOT_PTM is then benchmarked using
	five state-of-the-art methods, InsPecT, Virtual Expert Mass Spectrometrist
	(VEMS), Modi, Mascot, and X!Tandem. PILOT_PTM demonstrates superior
	accuracy on both the small and large scale proteome experiments.
	A protocol is finally developed for the analysis of a complete LC-MS/MS

	changes facilitated a detailed kinetic analysis for the ultrafast

	changed little with denaturant concentration or mutation but unfolding
	was very sensitive to denaturant and energy changes on mutation.
	The folding rate constant of 3 × 10(5) s(-1) in water decreased with

	complete disruption of the tertiary structure of the intermediate
	in a highly cooperative manner, being exquisitely sensitive to individual

	at five sites located in the cofactor-binding pocket that interact
	with the 2'-phosphate group of NADPH. These mutations conferred greater
	activity with NADH upon the Corynebacterium 2,5-DKG reductase [Banta,
	S., Swanson, B. A., Wu, S., Jarnagin, A., and Anderson, S. (2002)
	Protein Eng. 15, 131-140; (1)]. The best of these mutations have
	now been combined to see if further improvements can be obtained.
	In addition, several chimeric mutants have been produced that contain
	the same residues as are found in other members of the aldo-keto
	reductase superfamily that are naturally able to use NADH as a cofactor.
	The most active mutants obtained in this work were also combined
	with a previously reported substrate-binding pocket double mutant,
	F22Y/A272G. Mutant activity was assayed using activity-stained native
	polyacrylamide gels. Superior mutants were purified and subjected
	to a simplified kinetic analysis. The simplified kinetic analysis
	was extended for the most active mutants in order to obtain the kinetic
	parameters in the full-ordered bi bi rate equation in the absence
	of products, with both NADH and NADPH as cofactors. The best mutant
	2,5-DKG reductase produced in this work was the F22Y/K232G/R238H/A272G
	quadruple mutant, which exhibits activity with NADH that is more
	than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type enzyme,
	and it retains a high level of activity with NADPH. This new 2,5-DKG
	reductase may be a valuable new catalyst for use in vitamin C biosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Human aldehyde reductase is a NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase
	that is closely related (65% identity) to aldose reductase, an enzyme
	involved in the pathogenesis of some diabetic and galactosemic complications.
	In aldose reductase, the active site residue Tyr48 is the proton
	donor in a hydrogen-bonding network involving residues Asp43/Lys77,
	while His110 directs the orientation of substrates in the active
	site pocket. Mutation of the homologous Tyr49 to phenylalamine or
	histidine (Y49F or Y49H) and of Lys79 to methionine (K79M) in aldehyde
	reductase yields inactive enzymes, indicating similar roles for these
	residues in the catalytic mechanism of aldehyde reductase. A H112Q
	mutant aldehyde reductase exhibited a substantial decrease in catalytic
	efficiency (kcat/Km) for hydrophilic (average 150-fold) and aromatic
	substrates (average 4200-fold) and 50-fold higher IC50 values for
	a variety of inhibitors than that of the wild-type enzyme. The data
	suggest that His112 plays a major role in determining the substrate
	specificity of aldehyde reductase, similar to that shown earlier
	for the homologous His110 in aldose reductase [Bohren, K. M., et.
	al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 2021-2032]. Mutation of Ile298 or Val299
	affected the kinetic parameters to a much lesser degree. Unlike native
	aldose reductase, which contains a thiol-sensitive Cys298, neither
	the I298C or V299C mutant exhibited any thiol sensitivity, suggesting
	a geometry of the active site pocket different from that in aldose
	reductase. Also different from aldose reductase, the detection of
	a significant primary deuterium isotope effect on kcat (1.48 +/-
	0.02) shows that nucleotide exchange is only partially rate-limiting.
	Primary substrate and solvent deuterium isotope effects on the H112Q
	mutant suggest that hydride and proton transfers occur in two discrete
	steps with hydride transfer taking place first. Dissociation constants
	and spectroscopic and fluorimetric properties of nucleotide complexes
	with various mutants suggest that, in addition to Tyr49 and His112,
	Lys79 plays a hitherto unappreciated role in nucleotide binding.
	The mode of inhibition of aldehyde reductase by aldose reductase
	inhibitors (ARIs) is generally similar to that of aldose reductase
	and involves binding to the E:NADP+ complex, as shown by kinetic
	and direct inhibitor-binding experiments. The order of ARI potency
	was AL1576 (Ki = 60 nM) > tolrestat > ponalrestat > sorbinil > FK366
	> zopolrestat > alrestatin (Ki = 148 microM). Our data on aldehyde
	reductase suggest that the active site pocket significantly differs
	from that of aldose reductase, possibly due to the participation
	of the C-terminal loop in its formation.},

  volume = {10},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Horizontal transfer (HT) could play an important role
	in the long-term persistence of transposable elements (TEs) because
	it provides them with the possibility to avoid the checking effects
	of host-silencing mechanisms and natural selection, which would eventually
	drive their elimination from the genome. However, despite the increasing
	evidence for HT of TEs, its rate of occurrence among the TE pools
	of model eukaryotic organisms is still unknown. RESULTS: We have
	extracted and compared the nucleotide sequences of all potentially
	functional autonomous TEs present in the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster,
	D. simulans and D. yakuba - 1,436 insertions classified into 141
	distinct families - and show that a large fraction of the families
	found in two or more species display levels of genetic divergence
	and within-species diversity that are significantly lower than expected
	by assuming copy-number equilibrium and vertical transmission, and
	consistent with a recent origin by HT. Long terminal repeat (LTR)
	retrotransposons form nearly 90% of the HT cases detected. HT footprints
	are also frequent among DNA transposons (40% of families compared)
	but rare among non-LTR retroelements (6%). Our results suggest a
	genomic rate of 0.04 HT events per family per million years between
	the three species studied, as well as significant variation between
	major classes of elements. CONCLUSIONS: The genome-wide patterns
	of sequence diversity of the active autonomous TEs in the genomes
	of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba suggest that one-third
	of the TE families originated by recent HT between these species.
	This result emphasizes the important role of horizontal transmission
	in the natural history of Drosophila TEs.}

	pancreatic pseudocysts is reported; these patients complained of

	quadrants. Diagnosis was made by CT. In one case a progressive decrease
	of the pseudocyst was observed; the second patient was treated by
	a pseudocyst-jejunostomy; the last patient initially underwent a
	trans-gastric percutaneous drainage for infection of the pseudocyst
	and afterwards an open pseudocyst-gastrostomy. All patients were
	cured, even if the second patient during the postoperative course
	developed a pleuric effusion, which was treated by thoracentesis.
	Pancreatic pseudocysts in 20% of cases resolve spontaneously, as
	observed in one of our patients. In other cases, a surgical operation
	is needed, now feasible through an endoscopic, percutaneous, laparotomic
	or laparoscopic approach. The endoscopic and percutaneous approach
	are indicated only in selected cases, so that the "gold standard"
	treatment is still the laparotomic one, especially by a pseudocyst-jejunostomy,
	which also in our experience has given the best result. Very promising
	also, according to the latest data from the literature, seems the
	laparoscopic approach, by which a wide communication between the
	stomach and the pseudocyst is obtained.},

	Out of the 13 targets, six were predicted well by a number of groups.

	aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carcinogenesis. It is the only HSD of
	known structure in the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and
	may provide a paradigm for other mammalian HSDs in this family. The
	structure of the 3 alpha-HSD.NADP+ binary complex has been determined
	at 2.7 A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of
	23.4% with good geometry. The model is similar to other binary complexes
	in the AKR superfamily in that NADP+ binds at the C-terminal end
	of an alpha/beta barrel. However, it is unique in that NADP+ is bound
	in two alternate conformations, probably because of the lack of a
	salt-linked "safety belt" over the pyrophosphate bridge. The structure
	supports a previously proposed catalytic mechanism for carbonyl reduction
	in which Tyr 55 is the general acid, and its effective pKa is lowered
	by the adjacent Lys 84. We present evidence that the structurally
	distinct short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily may
	have convergently evolved a similar catalytic mechanism. Insight
	into substrate binding is offered by a crystal packing contact in
	which a neighboring molecule inserts a tryptophan residue (Trp 227)
	into an apolar cleft in 3 alpha-HSD. This cleft is proximal to the
	bound NADP+ cofactor and contains a surface of apolar residues (Leu
	54, Trp 86, Leu 122, Phe 128, Phe 129, Leu 137, Phe 139), making
	it a likely candidate for the substrate-binding site. Thus, in forming
	this crystal contact, Trp 227 may mimic a portion of a bound steroid.
	In addition, we propose that a water molecule in the active site
	indicates the position of the hydroxyl oxygen in a 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid
	substrate. Knowledge of the position of this water molecule, combined
	with the stereochemistry of hydride transfer, suggests that the alpha
	face of a bound steroid will be oriented toward the side of the apolar
	cleft containing Trp 86.},

	heteroatom oxygenation, dealkylation, epoxidation, aromatic hydroxylation,
	reduction, dehalogenation (Sono, M., Roach, M.P., Coulter, E.D.,

	successful model for the folding dynamics of small single-domain
	proteins. Complicating the interpretation of both simulations and
	experiments is the expectation that the effective diffusion coefficient
	D will in general depend on the position along the folding coordinate,
	and this dependence may vary for different coordinates. Here we explore
	the position dependence of D, its connection to protein internal
	friction, and the consequences for the interpretation of single-molecule
	experiments. We find a large decrease in D from unfolded to folded,
	for reaction coordinates that directly measure fluctuations in Cartesian
	configuration space, including those probed in single-molecule experiments.
	In contrast, D is almost independent of Q, the fraction of native
	amino acid contacts: Near the folded state, small fluctuations in
	position cause large fluctuations in Q, and vice versa for the unfolded
	state. In general, position-dependent free energies and diffusion
	coefficients for any two good reaction coordinates that separate
	reactant, product, and transition states, are related by a simple
	transformation, as we demonstrate. With this transformation, we obtain
	reaction coordinates with position-invariant D. The corresponding
	free-energy surfaces allow us to justify the assumptions used in
	estimating the speed limit for protein folding from experimental
	measurements of the reconfiguration time in the unfolded state, and
	also reveal intermediates hidden in the original free-energy projection.
	Lastly, we comment on the design of future single-molecule experiments

	true, native structures. The limitations often hinder the possibility
	of applying computational protein structure prediction methods in
	biochemical assignment and drug design that are very sensitive to
	structural details. Refinement of these low-resolution predicted
	models to high-resolution structures close to the native state, however,
	has proven to be extremely challenging. Thus, protein structure refinement
	remains a largely unsolved problem. Critical assessment of techniques
	for protein structure prediction (CASP) specifically indicated that
	most predictors participating in the refinement category still did
	not consistently improve model quality. Here, we propose a two-step
	refinement protocol, called 3Drefine, to consistently bring the initial
	model closer to the native structure. The first step is based on
	optimization of hydrogen bonding (HB) network and the second step
	applies atomic-level energy minimization on the optimized model using
	a composite physics and knowledge-based force fields. The approach
	has been evaluated on the CASP benchmark data and it exhibits consistent
	improvement over the initial structure in both global and local structural
	quality measures. 3Drefine method is also computationally inexpensive,
	consuming only few minutes of CPU time to refine a protein of typical
	length (300 residues). 3Drefine web server is freely available at

	cancer in her lifetime. It has been shown that screening for breast
	cancer can reduce breast cancer mortality. The use of a saliva-based
	test could prove to be very useful in post-operative and/or adjunctive
	therapy management of breast cancer patients. METHODS: The following
	study was undertaken to establish the possible usefulness of the
	salivary protein product of the oncogene c-erbB-2 in following patients
	diagnosed with carcinoma of the breast. Included in this study were
	25 patients with a mean age of 54 years with varying histological
	diagnoses and stages of carcinoma of the breast. ELISA assays for
	c-erbB-2 and CA 15-3 were performed on serum and stimulated whole
	saliva samples collected on all patients prior to any adjunct therapy
	or surgery and sequentially during therapy. RESULTS: The results
	of the GLM analyses using marker concentration as the dependent variable
	and treatment regimen and the serial assessments as independent variables
	yielded a significant overall model for both the serum (P < 0.007)
	and salivary (P < 0.017) c-erbB-2 markers. The model for serum c-erbB-2,
	however, exhibited a significant difference for treatment regimen
	(P < 0.001) with the chemotherapy and radiation treatment regimen
	being significantly different (P < 0.001) from the other treatment
	therapies. Time (serial assessments) was not significant. The model
	for the salivary c-erbB-2 marker was reversed. Treatment regimen
	was not significant for this model; however, time (serial assessments)
	was significant (P < 0.002). The serum and salivary CA 15-3 marker
	models yielded no significant results. Paired t-test analyses indicated
	that only the salivary c-erbB-2 concentrations exhibited a significant
	difference between the pre- and post-therapy values (t = 4.245, P
	< 0.0001). Additionally, salivary c-erbB-2 displayed greater percent
	reductions across all therapies as compared to the other markers.
	CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study appears to indicate that c-erbB-2
	protein expression in saliva may be a very useful diagnostic tool
	for measuring patient response to chemotherapy and/or surgical treatment
	of their disease.},

	distribution in conformations containing them. A second round of
	structure prediction trajectories are then guided by the predicted
	native feature distributions. We show that native features can be
	predicted at much higher than background rates, and that using the
	predicted feature distributions improves structure prediction in
	a benchmark of 28 proteins. The advantages of our approach are that

  abstract = {The active site of human aldose reductase contains two residues, His110
	and Tyr48, either of which could be the proton donor during catalysis.
	Tyr48 is a candidate since its hydroxyl group is in proximity to
	Lys77 and thus may have an abnormally low pKa value. To distinguish
	between these possibilities, we used site-directed mutagenesis to
	create the H110Q and H110A, the Y48F, Y48H, and Y48S, and the K77M
	mutant enzymes. The two His110 mutants resulted in a 1000-20,000-fold
	drop in kcat/Km, respectively, for the reduction of DL-glyceraldehyde
	at pH 7. The Y48F mutation caused total loss of activity, whereas
	the Y48H and Y48S mutants retained catalytic activity with kcat/Km
	reduced by 5 orders of magnitude. The K77M mutant is an inactive
	enzyme. Kinetic studies using xylose stereoisomers show that the
	wild-type enzyme distinguishes between D-xylose, L-xylose, and D-lyxose
	up to 150-fold better than the H110A or H110Q mutants. The His110
	mutants do not effectively discriminate between these isomers (4-11-fold).
	The crystal structure of the Y48H mutant refined at 1.8-A resolution
	shows that the overall structure is not significantly different from
	the wild-type structure. Electron densities for the histidine side
	chain and a new water molecule fill the space occupied by Tyr48 in
	the wild-type enzyme. The water molecule is in hydrogen-bonding distance
	to the N zeta group of Lys77 and to the N epsilon of His48 and fills
	the space occupied by the hydroxyl group of tyrosine in the wild-type
	structure. These findings suggest that proton transfer is mediated
	in the Y48H mutant enzyme by the water molecule. The Y48H mutant
	shows large and equal primary deuterium isotope effects on kcat and
	kcat/Km (1.81 +/- 0.03), providing direct evidence for hydride transfer
	as the rate-determining step in this mutant. Deuterium solvent isotope
	effects indicate that the relative contribution of proton transfer
	to this step of the catalytic cascade is much less important for
	the Y48H mutant than for the wild-type enzyme [D2O(kcat/Km) = 1.06
	+/- 0.02 and 4.73 +/- 0.23, respectively]. The kinetic and mutagenesis
	data, together with structural data, indicate that His 110 plays
	an important role in the orientation of substrates in the active
	site pocket, while Tyr48 is the proton donor during aldehyde reduction
	by aldose reductase.},

	demonstrated catalytic activity significantly above background. One
	of the proteins, PZD2, displayed "burst" phase kinetics at high substrate
	concentrations, consistent with the formation of a stable enzyme
	intermediate. The kinetic parameters of PZD2 are comparable to early
	catalytic Abs. But, unlike catalytic Ab design, our design procedure
	is independent of fold, suggesting a possible mechanism for examining

  volume = {11},
  pages = {1937-44},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {Although much of the motivation for experimental studies of protein
	folding is to obtain insights for improving protein structure prediction,
	there has been relatively little connection between experimental
	protein folding studies and computational structural prediction work
	in recent years. In the present study, we show that the relationship
	between protein folding rates and the contact order (CO) of the native
	structure has implications for ab initio protein structure prediction.
	Rosetta ab initio folding simulations produce a dearth of high CO
	structures and an excess of low CO structures, as expected if the
	computer simulations mimic to some extent the actual folding process.
	Consistent with this, the majority of failures in ab initio prediction
	in the CASP4 (critical assessment of structure prediction) experiment
	involved high CO structures likely to fold much more slowly than
	the lower CO structures for which reasonable predictions were made.
	This bias against high CO structures can be partially alleviated
	by performing large numbers of additional simulations, selecting
	out the higher CO structures, and eliminating the very low CO structures;
	this leads to a modest improvement in prediction quality. More significant
	improvements in predictions for proteins with complex topologies
	may be possible following significant increases in high-performance
	computing power, which will be required for thoroughly sampling high
	CO conformations (high CO proteins can take six orders of magnitude
	longer to fold than low CO proteins). Importantly for such a strategy,
	simulations performed for high CO structures converge much less strongly
	than those for low CO structures, and hence, lack of simulation convergence
	can indicate the need for improved sampling of high CO conformations.
	The parallels between Rosetta simulations and folding in vivo may
	extend to misfolding: The very low CO structures that accumulate
	in Rosetta simulations consist primarily of local up-down beta-sheets
	that may resemble precursors to amyloid formation.},

  volume = {23},
  pages = {159-67},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {Glyphosate is used extensively as a non-selective herbicide by both
	professional applicators and consumers and its use is likely to increase
	further as it is one of the first herbicides against which crops
	have been genetically modified to increase their tolerance. Commercial
	glyphosate-based formulations most commonly range from concentrates
	containing 41% or more glyphosate to 1% glyphosate formulations marketed
	for domestic use. They generally consist of an aqueous mixture of
	the isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate, a surfactant, and various
	minor components including anti-foaming and colour agents, biocides
	and inorganic ions to produce pH adjustment. The mechanisms of toxicity
	of glyphosate formulations are complicated. Not only is glyphosate
	used as five different salts but commercial formulations of it contain
	surfactants, which vary in nature and concentration. As a result,
	human poisoning with this herbicide is not with the active ingredient
	alone but with complex and variable mixtures. Therefore, It is difficult
	to separate the toxicity of glyphosate from that of the formulation
	as a whole or to determine the contribution of surfactants to overall
	toxicity. Experimental studies suggest that the toxicity of the surfactant,
	polyoxyethyleneamine (POEA), is greater than the toxicity of glyphosate
	alone and commercial formulations alone. There is insufficient evidence
	to conclude that glyphosate preparations containing POEA are more
	toxic than those containing alternative surfactants. Although surfactants
	probably contribute to the acute toxicity of glyphosate formulations,
	the weight of evidence is against surfactants potentiating the toxicity
	of glyphosate.Accidental ingestion of glyphosate formulations is
	generally associated with only mild, transient, gastrointestinal
	features. Most reported cases have followed the deliberate ingestion
	of the concentrated formulation of Roundup (The use of trade names
	is for product identification purposes only and does not imply endorsement.)
	(41% glyphosate as the IPA salt and 15% POEA). There is a reasonable
	correlation between the amount ingested and the likelihood of serious
	systemic sequelae or death. Advancing age is also associated with
	a less favourable prognosis. Ingestion of >85 mL of the concentrated
	formulation is likely to cause significant toxicity in adults. Gastrointestinal
	corrosive effects, with mouth, throat and epigastric pain and dysphagia
	are common. Renal and hepatic impairment are also frequent and usually
	reflect reduced organ perfusion. Respiratory distress, impaired consciousness,
	pulmonary oedema, infiltration on chest x-ray, shock, arrythmias,
	renal failure requiring haemodialysis, metabolic acidosis and hyperkalaemia
	may supervene in severe cases. Bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmias
	are often present pre-terminally. Dermal exposure to ready-to-use
	glyphosate formulations can cause irritation and photo-contact dermatitis
	has been reported occasionally; these effects are probably due to
	the preservative Proxel (benzisothiazolin-3-one). Severe skin burns
	are very rare. Inhalation is a minor route of exposure but spray
	mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the
	mouth, tingling and throat irritation. Eye exposure may lead to mild
	conjunctivitis, and superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation
	is delayed or inadequate. Management is symptomatic and supportive,
	and skin decontamination with soap and water after removal of contaminated
	clothing should be undertaken in cases of dermal exposure.},

  abstract = {Obesity is a major epidemic, but its causes are still unclear. In
	this article, we investigate the relation between the intake of high-fructose
	corn syrup (HFCS) and the development of obesity. We analyzed food
	consumption patterns by using US Department of Agriculture food consumption
	tables from 1967 to 2000. The consumption of HFCS increased > 1000%
	between 1970 and 1990, far exceeding the changes in intake of any
	other food or food group. HFCS now represents > 40% of caloric sweeteners
	added to foods and beverages and is the sole caloric sweetener in
	soft drinks in the United States. Our most conservative estimate
	of the consumption of HFCS indicates a daily average of 132 kcal
	for all Americans aged > or = 2 y, and the top 20% of consumers of
	caloric sweeteners ingest 316 kcal from HFCS/d. The increased use
	of HFCS in the United States mirrors the rapid increase in obesity.
	The digestion, absorption, and metabolism of fructose differ from
	those of glucose. Hepatic metabolism of fructose favors de novo lipogenesis.
	In addition, unlike glucose, fructose does not stimulate insulin
	secretion or enhance leptin production. Because insulin and leptin
	act as key afferent signals in the regulation of food intake and
	body weight, this suggests that dietary fructose may contribute to
	increased energy intake and weight gain. Furthermore, calorically
	sweetened beverages may enhance caloric overconsumption. Thus, the
	increase in consumption of HFCS has a temporal relation to the epidemic
	of obesity, and the overconsumption of HFCS in calorically sweetened
	beverages may play a role in the epidemic of obesity.},

  abstract = {CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile
	and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed
	over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of
	biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic
	acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in
	solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such
	systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools
	that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free
	energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis
	techniques, and model-building capabilities. The CHARMM program is
	applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle
	systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number
	of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular
	mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions
	with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit
	solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous
	platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article
	provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis
	on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article
	in 1983.},

	to the active site of the enzyme lysozyme. A comparison is made of

	a full conventional molecular dynamics simulation of lysozyme. Excellent
	agreement between the two approaches is obtained. The influence of
	solvent on the residues in the active site region is explored and
	it is shown that both the structure and dynamics are affected. Of
	particular importance for the structure of the protein is the solvation
	of polar residues and the stabilization of like-charged ion pairs.
	The magnitude of the fluctuations is only slightly altered by the
	solvent; the overall increase in the root-mean-square fluctuations,
	relative to the vacuum run, is 11%. The solvent effect on dynamical
	properties is found not to be simply related to the solvent viscosity.
	Both the solvent exposure and dynamic aspects of protein-solvent
	interactions, including the relative time scales of the motions,
	are shown to play a role. The effects of the protein on solvent dynamics
	and structure are also observed to be significant. The solvent molecules
	around atoms in charged, polar and apolar side-chains show markedly
	different diffusion coefficients as well as exhibiting different
	solvation structures. One key example is the water around apolar
	groups, which is much less mobile than bulk water, or water solvating

	the gene addition problem of optimally selecting which foreign genes
	to recombine into E. coli, as well as the gene deletion problem of

	theoretical production of the 20 amino acids for aerobic growth on

  abstract = {Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides [NAD and NADP with both referred

	their stereochemical similarity where the only difference is a phosphomonoester
	on the ribose near the adenine of NADP, they show different biochemical
	reactivities with NAD behaving as an oxidant and NADP as a reductant.
	NAD(P)-dependent enzymes generally share a common open alpha/beta
	fold with few exceptions only recently structurally characterized.
	This study of the molecular evolution of the NAD(P) binding domains,
	possible given the large number of known molecular structures, addresses
	two main questions: 1) can a common fold exist in different biological
	systems (divergent evolution) and 2) does a relationship exist among
	similar biological systems that display different folds (convergent
	evolution)? Both the structures of mono- and dinucleotide binding
	domains have been classified by cluster analysis based on the similarity
	evaluated by their main chain C alpha superposition. Moreover, the
	cofactor conformations and the stereochemical characteristics of
	their pockets have also been classified by analogous methods on the
	basis of the published tertiary structures. Two primary results appear:
	1) the classification of the mononucleotide binding domains is different
	from that of the dinucleotide binding folds and 2) both divergent
	and convergent evolutionary pathways can be hypothesized, the latter
	less frequently observed and less pronounced but nevertheless evident.
	The generally accepted hypothesis that dinucleotide binding domains
	have evolved by gene duplication of primordial genes coding for the
	smaller mononucleotide binding domains is acceptable but the two
	halves of the resulting dinucleotide binding domains are evolutionarily
	uncorrelated. The NH2-terminal mononucleotide binding domain is less
	variable than the COOH-terminal half, probably because it involves
	the binding of the ADP moiety of NAD(P) invariant in all examined
	systems. There is evidence to postulate that evolutionary pathways
	for NAD(P)-dependent enzymes are both divergent and convergent. In
	fact, nearly all combinations of similarity dissimilarity in overall
	fold, cofactor conformation, and cofactor binding pocket structural
	characteristics for each enzyme pair examined are possible. The NAD(P)-dependent
	enzymes apparently provide a canonical example of an evolutionary
	principle that "anything goes."},

	features detected with contrast-enhanced US. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
	Thirty-six patients aged 42-63 years (mean age 55 years) with a single
	breast lesion previously detected at standard mammography were studied.
	All US examinations were performed using an ATL HDI 5000 ultrasound
	device with a 5-10 MHz linear-array transducer, before and after
	administration of ultrasound contrast medium Levovist (Schering(R),
	Berlin) was administered by bolus injection (2 ml/s) via a 20 G catheter
	probe. The mechanical index was set to high to obtain instant rupture
	of the microbubbles under insonation. Intensity/time curves of the
	transient scattering in the region of interest (ROI) after contrast
	administration were extrapolated. The areas under the ROI curves
	were also evaluated to quantitatively assess the scattering. RESULTS:
	The US baseline study and colour Doppler US identified 19 benign
	lesions (15 histologically proven) and 17 malignant lesions (16 histologically
	proven). The administration of contrast medium did not improve the
	specificity of the examination. Only by plotting the intensity/time
	curves of the regions of interest (ROI) and evaluating the areas
	under the ROI curves, was a significant correlation detected between
	US and histopathologic diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although further evaluation
	on a larger series is needed, the analysis of breast lesions by contrast-enhanced
	perfusion US seems to be a promising technique. Perfusion US can
	usefully complement high-frequency US, especially when mammography

  abstract = {Covalent modification can expand a protein's functional capacity.
	Fluorescent or radioactive labeling, for instance, allows imaging
	of a protein in real time. Labeling with an affinity probe enables
	isolation of target proteins and other interacting molecules. At
	the other end of this functional spectrum, protein structures can
	be naturally altered by enzymatic action. Protein-protein interactions,
	genetic regulation, and a range of cellular processes are under the
	purview of these post-translational modifications. The ability of
	protein chemists to install these covalent additions selectively
	has been critical for elucidating their roles in biology. Frequently
	the transformations must be applied in a site-specific manner, which
	demands the most selective chemistry. In this Account, we discuss
	the development and application of such chemistry in our laboratory.
	A centerpiece of our strategy is a "tag-and-modify" approach, which
	entails sequential installation of a uniquely reactive chemical group
	into the protein (the "tag") and the selective or specific modification
	of this group. The chemical tag can be a natural or unnatural amino
	acid residue. Of the natural residues, cysteine is the most widely
	used as a tag. Early work in our program focused on selective disulfide
	formation in the synthesis of glycoproteins. For certain applications,
	the susceptibility of disulfides to reduction was a limitation and
	prompted the development of several methods for the synthesis of
	more stable thioether modifications. The desulfurization of disulfides
	and conjugate addition to dehydroalanine are two routes to these
	modifications. The dehydroalanine tag has since proven useful as
	a general precursor to many modifications after conjugate addition
	of various nucleophiles; phosphorylated, glycosylated, peptidylated,
	prenylated, and even mimics of methylated and acetylated lysine-containing
	proteins are all accessible from dehydroalanine. While cysteine is
	a useful tag for selective modification, unnatural residues present
	the opportunity for bio-orthogonal chemistry. Azide-, arylhalide-,
	alkyne-, and alkene-containing amino acids can be incorporated into
	proteins genetically and can be specifically modified through various
	transformations. These transformations often rely on metal catalysis.
	The Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne addition, Ru-catalyzed olefin metathesis,
	and Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling are examples of such transformations.
	In the course of adapting these reactions to protein modification,
	we learned much about the behavior of these reactions in water, and
	in some cases entirely new catalysts were developed. Through a combination
	of these bio-orthogonal transformations from the panel of tag-and-modify
	reactions, multiple and distinct modifications can be installed on
	protein surfaces. Multiple modifications are common in natural systems,
	and synthetic access to these proteins has enabled study of their
	biological role. Throughout these investigations, much has been learned
	in chemistry and biology. The demands of selective protein modification
	have revealed many aspects of reaction mechanisms, which in turn
	have guided the design of reagents and catalysts that allow their
	successful deployment in water and in biological milieu. With this
	ability to modify proteins, it is now possible to interrogate biological
	systems with precision that was not previously possible.},

	The purified target alpha-amylase, Amy-FC1, showed strong hydrolytic
	activity on soluble starch (kcat/Km=6.47 x 10(3) min(-1)(ml/mg))
	and selective activity on gamma- and beta-cyclodextrins, but not
	on alpha-cyclodextrin. The enzyme worked optimally at 70 degrees
	C in a neutral pH range with t(1/2) of 240 min in the presence of
	Ca(2+) and starch. Maltose, matotriose, and maltotetraose were the
	major products from starch hydrolysis but prolonged reaction led
	to the production of glucose, maltose, and maltotriose from starch,
	cyclodextrins, and maltooligosaccharides (G3-G7). The amylase showed
	remarkable glucose tolerance up to 1 M, but was more sensitive to
	inhibition by maltose. The deduced protein primary structure from
	the putative gene revealed that the enzyme shared moderate homology
	between alpha-amylases from Aspergilli and Lipomyces sp. This thermotolerant,
	glucose tolerant maltooligosaccharide-forming alpha-amylase is potent
	for biotechnological application.},

	probability of finding each type of secondary structure at every
	position in the sequence. In addition to providing a reliable estimate
	of the accuracy of the predictions, this method gives a more accurate
	Q3 (74.6%) than the cutoff method which is commonly used. Use of
	these predictions in jury methods improves the Q3 to 74.8%, the best
	available at present. On a database of 126 proteins commonly used
	for comparison of prediction methods, the jury predictions are 76.6%
	accurate. An estimate of the overall Q3 for a given sequence is made
	by averaging the estimated accuracy of the prediction over all residues
	in the sequence. As an example, the analysis is applied to the target
	beta-cryptogein, which was a difficult target for ab initio predictions
	in the CASP2 study; it shows that the prediction made with the present
	method (62% of residues correct) is close to the expected accuracy
	(66%) for this protein. The larger database and use of a new network
	training protocol also improve structural class prediction accuracy

	bindings to libraries that define Rosetta functions including those
	for accessing and manipulating protein structure, calculating energies
	and running Monte Carlo-based simulations. PyRosetta can be used
	in two ways: (i) interactively, using iPython and (ii) script-based,
	using Python scripting. Interactive mode contains a number of help
	features and is ideal for beginners while script-mode is best suited
	for algorithm development. PyRosetta has similar computational performance
	to Rosetta, can be easily scaled up for cluster applications and
	has been implemented for algorithms demonstrating protein docking,
	protein folding, loop modeling and design. AVAILABILITY: PyRosetta
	is a stand-alone package available at http://www.pyrosetta.org under
	the Rosetta license which is free for academic and non-profit users.
	A tutorial, user's manual and sample scripts demonstrating usage

  abstract = {Recent advances in efficient and accurate treatment of solvent with

	substantially refine the protein structures generated by various

	As demonstrated in a recent CASPR experiment, improvement can be
	quite reliably achieved when the initial models are sufficiently
	close to the native basin (e.g., 3-4 A C(alpha) RMSD). A key element
	to effective refinement is to incorporate reliable structural information
	into the simulation protocol. Without intimate knowledge of the target
	and prediction protocol used to generate the initial structural models,
	it can be assumed that the regular secondary structure elements (helices
	and strands) and overall fold topology are largely correct to start
	with, such that the protocol limits itself to the scope of refinement
	and focuses the sampling in vicinity of the initial structure. The
	secondary structures can be enforced by dihedral restraints and the
	topology through structural contacts, implemented as either multiple
	pair-wise C(alpha) distance restraints or a single sidechain distance
	matrix restraint. The restraints are weakly imposed with flat-bottom
	potentials to allow sufficient flexibility for structural rearrangement.
	Refinement is further facilitated by enhanced sampling of advanced
	techniques such as the replica exchange method (REX). In general,
	for single domain proteins of small to medium sizes, 3-5 nanoseconds
	of REX/GB refinement simulations appear to be sufficient for reasonable
	convergence. Clustering of the resulting structural ensembles can
	yield refined models over 1.0 A closer to the native structure in
	C(alpha) RMSD. Substantial improvement of sidechain contacts and
	rotamer states can also be achieved in most cases. Additional improvement
	is possible with longer sampling and knowledge of the robust structural
	features in the initial models for a given prediction protocol. Nevertheless,
	limitations still exist in sampling as well as force field accuracy,
	manifested as difficulty in refinement of long and flexible loops.},

  abstract = {Human estrogen receptor alpha (hERalpha) and human androgen receptor
	exhibit exquisite ligand specificity, which underlies their remarkable
	ability to effect ligand-regulated gene transcription in a highly
	distinctive and specific manner. Here we used a directed evolution
	approach to create hERalpha variants with enhanced androgen specificity
	and affinity with the goal to better understand the molecular basis
	of ER ligand specificity and the evolutionary mechanism of nuclear
	receptors. We developed a sensitive yeast two-hybrid system to screen
	for hERalpha variants with increased transactivation potency toward
	testosterone. After two rounds of directed evolution, we identified
	five hERalpha variants with dramatically improved transactivation
	potency toward testosterone in both yeast and mammalian cells. These
	variants showed up to 7,600-fold improvement in the binding affinity
	for testosterone and only slightly reduced affinity toward 17beta-estradiol.
	Detailed analysis of these evolved variants and a few site-directed
	mutants generated de novo led to several unexpected findings including
	the following. 1) Only two beneficial mutations were needed to create
	hERalpha variants with near nanomolar affinity for testosterone.
	2) Some beneficial mutations were synergistic, context-dependent,
	or non-additive. 3) Of the five identified beneficial mutations,
	four of them were not in the ER ligand binding pocket and yet exerted
	important action on ligand specificity. 4) The single ligand-contacting
	mutation E353Q plays a dominant role in discriminating androgens
	and estrogens. These results, viewed in conjunction with the ligand
	exploitation model of nuclear receptor evolution, suggest that the
	mutation E353Q may represent a key event in the evolution of androgen
	receptors from an ancestral estrogen receptor and that ligand promiscuity
	may play an important role in the creation of new nuclear receptors
	via divergent evolution.},

	Remarkably, the refolding rates, which are larger than the value

	boidinii (CbXR) was previously reported to produce xylitol from xylose
	while metabolizing glucose [Cirino et al. (2006) Biotechnol Bioeng
	95(6): 1167-1176]. This study aims to understand the role of NADPH
	supply in xylitol yield and the contribution of key central carbon
	metabolism enzymes toward xylitol production. Studies in which the
	expression of CbXR or a xylose transporter was increased suggest
	that enzyme activity and xylose transport are not limiting xylitol
	production in PC09. A constraints-based stoichiometric metabolic
	network model was used to understand the roles of central carbon
	metabolism reactions and xylose transport energetics on the theoretical
	maximum molar xylitol yield (xylitol produced per glucose consumed),
	and xylitol yields (Y(RPG)) were measured from resting cell biotransformations
	with various PC09 derivative strains. For the case of xylose-proton
	symport, omitting the Zwf (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) or
	PntAB (membrane-bound transhydrogenase) reactions or TCA cycle activity
	from the model reduces the theoretical maximum yield from 9.2 to
	8.8, 3.6, and 8.0 mol xylitol (mol glucose)(-1), respectively. Experimentally,
	deleting pgi (encoding phosphoglucose isomerase) from strain PC09
	improves the yield from 3.4 to 4.0 mol xylitol (mol glucose)(-1),
	while deleting either or both E. coli transhydrogenases (sthA and
	pntA) has no significant effect on the measured yield. Deleting either
	zwf or sucC (TCA cycle) significantly reduces the yield from 3.4
	to 2.0 and 2.3 mol xylitol (mol glucose)(-1), respectively. Expression
	of a xylose reductase with relaxed cofactor specificity increases
	the yield to 4.0. The large discrepancy between theoretical maximum
	and experimentally determined yield values suggests that biocatalysis
	is compromised by pathways competing for reducing equivalents and
	dissipating energy. The metabolic role of transhydrogenases during
	E. coli biocatalysis has remained largely unspecified. Our results
	demonstrate the importance of direct NADPH supply by NADP+-utilizing
	enzymes in central metabolism for driving heterologous NADPH-dependent
	reactions, and suggest that the pool of reduced cofactors available
	for biotransformation is not readily interchangeable via transhydrogenase.},

	of packing of the hydrophobic core and some additional features,
	such as cross-helical H bonds. Comparison of the x-ray structures
	indicates that the nL substitution produces only local perturbations.
	Consequently, the finding that the small stabilization by the mutation

  abstract = {Robetta is a fully automated protein structure prediction server that
	uses the Rosetta fragment-insertion method. It combines template-based
	and de novo structure prediction methods in an attempt to produce
	high quality models that cover every residue of a submitted sequence.
	The first step in the procedure is the automatic detection of the
	locations of domains and selection of the appropriate modeling protocol
	for each domain. For domains matched to a homolog with an experimentally
	characterized structure by PSI-BLAST or Pcons2, Robetta uses a new
	alignment method, called K*Sync, to align the query sequence onto
	the parent structure. It then models the variable regions by allowing
	them to explore conformational space with fragments in fashion similar
	to the de novo protocol, but in the context of the template. When
	no structural homolog is available, domains are modeled with the
	Rosetta de novo protocol, which allows the full length of the domain
	to explore conformational space via fragment-insertion, producing
	a large decoy ensemble from which the final models are selected.
	The Robetta server produced quite reasonable predictions for targets
	in the recent CASP-5 and CAFASP-3 experiments, some of which were
	at the level of the best human predictions.},

  abstract = {NAD(+)-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH),
	a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family,
	catalyzes the first step in the catabolic pathways of prostaglandins
	and lipoxins, and is believed to be the key enzyme responsible for
	the biological inactivation of these biologically potent eicosanoids.
	The enzyme utilizes NAD(+) specifically as a coenzyme. Potential
	amino acid residues involved in binding NAD(+) and facilitating enzyme
	catalysis have been partially identified. In this report, we propose
	that three more residues in 15-PGDH, Ile-17, Asn-91, and Val-186,
	are also involved in the interaction with NAD(+). Site-directed mutagenesis
	was used to examine their roles in binding NAD(+). Several mutants
	(I17A, I17V, I17L, I17E, I17K, N91A, N91D, N91K, V186A, V186I, V186D,
	and V186K) were prepared, expressed as glutathione S-transferase
	(GST) fusion enzymes in Escherichia coli, and purified by GSH-agarose
	affinity chromatography. Mutants I17E, I17K, N91L, N91K, and V186D
	were found to be inactive. Mutants N91A, N91D, V186A, and V186K exhibited
	comparable activities to the wild type enzyme. However, mutants I17A,
	I17V, I17L, and V186I had higher activity than the wild type. Especially,
	the activities of I17L and V186I were increased nearly 4- and 5-fold,
	respectively. The k(cat)/K(m) ratios of all active mutants for PGE(2)
	were similar to that of the wild type enzyme. However, the k(cat)/K(m)
	ratios of mutants I17A and N91A for NAD(+) were decreased 5- and
	10-fold, respectively, whereas the k(cat)/K(m) ratios of mutants
	I17V, N91D, V186I, and V186K for NAD(+) were comparable to that of
	the wild type enzyme. The k(cat)/K(m) ratios of mutants I17L and
	V186A for NAD(+) were increased over nearly 2-fold. These results
	suggest that Ile-17, Asn-91, and Val-186 are involved in the interaction
	with NAD(+) and contribute to the full catalytic activity of 15-PGDH.},

	alpha-helix that lies nearly parallel to the acceptor stem and makes
	many contacts with its sugar-phosphate backbone. Although the geometry
	of this alpha-helix is nearly ideal in all available cocrystal structures,
	the helix contains a highly conserved, potentially helix-breaking

	(C74>C75>A76 addition). We also examined the effects of these mutations
	on tRNA binding and the kinetics of CCA addition, and performed a

	the role of P295 in nucleotide transfer. Our data indicate that CCA-adding
	activity does not correlate with the stability of the pre-addition

	(300 residues). We observe an average structural improvement of 1\%
	in GDT_TS, for predictions that have low and medium homology to known
	PDB structures (Global Distance Test score or GDT_TS between 50 and
	80\%). We also observe a marked improvement in the stereochemistry

	predicted models in the refinement category at CASP7 and CASP8. These
	improvements in structure and stereochemistry prove the usefulness

	curve to PAR2-AP was performed on rat thoracic aorta with or without
	a functional endothelium, and the effect of inhibitors was evaluated.
	The effect of PAR2-AP (10(-7)-3 x 10(-5) M) on endothelium-denuded
	aorta was also evaluated after tissue incubation with sodium nitroprusside.
	RESULTS: PAR2-AP (10(-7)-3 x 10(-5) M) caused an endothelium-dependent
	relaxation abolished by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, L-NAME,
	and by the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3-a]
	quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), but unaffected by geldanamycin. Vasorelaxant
	effect of PAR2-AP was only partially inhibited by the adenylyl cyclase
	inhibitor, 9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine (SQ 22,536),
	and it was increased by tissue incubation with the phosphodiesterase
	inhibitor, rolipram. On tissue without endothelium, PAR2-AP did not
	cause vasorelaxation, up to a concentration of 10(-4) M. However,
	after tissue incubation with sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 3 x 10(-9)
	M), the vasorelaxant effect of PAR2-AP was restored. Following tissue
	incubation with PAR2-AP, cAMP levels were significantly increased
	compared to control values. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that
	vasorelaxation induced by PAR2-AP is modulated by basal nitric oxide
	with an involvement of both cyclic nucleotides, cGMP and cAMP.},

	with the 6-31G* basis set. For the nucleic acid fragments, we used

	The charges for the deoxyribose nucleosides and nucleotides are derived
	using multiple-molecule fitting and restrained electrostatic potential
	(RESP) fits,1,2 with Lagrangian multipliers ensuring a net charge
	of 0 or Â± 1. We suggest that the preferred approach for deriving
	charges for nucleosides and nucleotides involves allowing only C1?
	and H1? of the sugar to vary as the nucleic acid base, with the remainder
	of sugar and backbone atoms forced to be equivalent. For peptide
	fragments, we have combined multiple conformation fitting, previously
	employed by Williams3 and Reynolds et al.,4 with the RESP approach1,2
	to derive charges for blocked dipeptides appropriate for each of
	the 20 naturally occuring amino acids. Based on our results for propyl

	to give charges that represent well the conformationally dependent
	electrostatic properties of molecules, provided that these two conformations
	contain different values of the dihedral angles that terminate in
	heteroatoms or hydrogens attached to heteroatoms. In these blocked
	dipeptide models, it is useful to require equivalent Nâ€”H and C?O
	charges for all amino acids with a given net charge (except proline),
	and this is accomplished in a straightforward fashion with multiple-molecule
	fitting. Finally, the application of multiple Lagrangian constraints
	allows for the derivation of monomeric residues with the appropriate
	net charge from a chemically blocked version of the residue. The
	multiple Lagrange constraints also enable charges from two or more
	molecules to be spliced together in a well-defined fashion. Thus,
	the combined use of multiple molecules, multiple conformations, multiple
	Lagrangian constraints, and RESP fitting is shown to be a powerful
	approach to deriving electrostatic charges for biopolymers. Â© 1995

	triple mutation leads to a switch in favor of NADP specificity but
	with a kcat/KM ratio 50- and 80-fold less than that observed for
	the wild type with NAD and for the chloroplast GAPDH with NADP, respectively.

	The model system used is the 1.2 A resolution crystal structure of
	the 46 residue protein crambin, from which a set of 240 approximate
	distance restraints, divided into three ranges (2.5 +/- 0.5, 3.0+0.5(-1.0)
	and 4 +/- 1 A), is derived. This interproton distance set comprises
	159 short-range ([i-j] less than or equal to 5) and 56 ([i-j] greater
	than 5) long-range inter-residue distances and 25 intra-residue distances.
	Restrained molecular dynamics are carried out using a number of different
	protocols starting from two initial structures: a completely extended
	beta-strand; and an extended structure with two alpha-helices in
	the same positions as in the crystal structure (residues 7 to 19,
	and 23 to 30) and all other residues in the form of extended beta-strands.
	The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) atomic differences between these two
	initial structures and the crystal structure are 43 A and 23 A, respectively.
	It is shown that, provided protocols are used that permit the secondary
	structure elements to form at least partially prior to folding into
	a tertiary structure, convergence to the correct final structure,
	both globally and locally, is achieved. The r.m.s. atomic differences
	between the converged restrained dynamics structures and the crystal
	structure range from 1.5 to 2.2 A for the backbone atoms and from
	2.0 to 2.8 A for all atoms. The r.m.s. atomic difference between
	the X-ray structure and the structure obtained by first averaging
	the co-ordinates of the converged restrained dynamics structures
	is even smaller: 1.0 A for the backbone atoms and 1.6 A for all atoms.
	These results provide a measure with which to judge future experimental
	results on proteins whose crystal structures are unknown. In addition,

	The artificial urine matrix was characterized by cyclic voltammetry
	at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES),
	showing that components of that aqueous phase truncate the available
	potential window at the ITIES. The transfer of three cationic drugs
	from aqueous artificial urine to the 1,2-dichloroethane organic electrolyte

	across the artificial urine-organic interface. However, sotalol transfer
	was not possible within the available potential window. Extraction
	of propranolol and timolol from artificial urine into an organogel
	phase, by electrochemically modulated liquid-liquid extraction, was
	examined. The application of potentials positive of the drugs' formal
	transfer potentials enabled the selective extraction of both propranolol

	This work demonstrates the practical utility of EMLLE for the selective
	extraction of target compounds from a complex sample matrix.},

	similar to that of NADP(+) in glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (GFOR)
	from Zymomonas mobilis. Due to variations in length and sequence

	NADP(+) adopts a different orientation in AFR caused by residue Arg38
	forming hydrogen bonds with the 2'-phosphate moiety of NADP(+) and
	cation-pi stacking interactions with the adenine ring. Amino acid
	replacements in AFR (S10G, A13G, and S33D) showed that Ala13 is crucial

	energy function and side-chain repacking algorithm to account for
	flexibility of all side chains in the binding site. Here we present
	extensions to RosettaLigand that incorporate full ligand flexibility

	flexibility is found to produce more correct docked complexes and
	to lower the average RMSD of the best-scoring docked poses relative

  abstract = {We have developed and experimentally tested a novel computational
	approach for the de novo design of hydrophobic cores. A pair of computer
	programs has been written, the first of which creates a "custom"
	rotamer library for potential hydrophobic residues, based on the
	backbone structure of the protein of interest. The second program
	uses a genetic algorithm to globally optimize for a low energy core
	sequence and structure, using the custom rotamer library as input.
	Success of the programs in predicting the sequences of native proteins
	indicates that they should be effective tools for protein design.
	Using these programs, we have designed and engineered several variants
	of the phage 434 cro protein, containing five, seven, or eight sequence
	changes in the hydrophobic core. As controls, we have produced a
	variant consisting of a randomly generated core with six sequence
	changes but equal volume relative to the native core and a variant
	with a "minimalist" core containing predominantly leucine residues.
	Two of the designs, including one with eight core sequence changes,
	have thermal stabilities comparable to the native protein, whereas
	the third design and the minimalist protein are significantly destabilized.
	The randomly designed control is completely unfolded under equivalent
	conditions. These results suggest that rational de novo design of
	hydrophobic cores is feasible, and stress the importance of specific
	packing interactions for the stability of proteins. A surprising
	aspect of the results is that all of the variants display highly
	cooperative thermal denaturation curves and reasonably dispersed
	NMR spectra. This suggests that the non-core residues of a protein
	play a significant role in determining the uniqueness of the folded
	structure.},

  abstract = {This study suggests a molecular mechanism that explains the accumulation
	of denaturated proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of beta-cells.
	Such states were frequently observed in beta-cells experiencing increased
	demand for insulin production and were shown to lead to secretory
	dysfunction and diabetes. Here, a self-consistent kinetic model is
	used to investigate changes in protein translation due to ER overloading.
	The model is based on a molecular theory that relates the molecular
	composition and level of molecular crowding in the ER to the kinetic
	rates of protein folding/misfolding and transit to the Golgi apparatus
	(GA). This study suggests that molecular crowding forces can increase
	protein misfolding and impair the transport to the GA, thus overwhelming
	the quality control mechanism in the ER. A continual accumulation
	of toxic residues in the ER enhances even further the molecular crowding,
	accelerating protein denaturation. This article shows that molecular
	crowding affects differently the transit of various proteins through
	the ER. Apparently, the molecular crowding level that can inhibit
	the transport of native proinsulin to the GA influences to a lesser
	extent the transit of proamylin, a much smaller peptide cosynthesized
	with proinsulin in the ER. Smaller-volume misfolded proinsulin species
	may also win the passage competition through the ER and move on the
	secretory track. However, misfolded proinsulin fails the conversion
	to active insulin. This study can help us to decipher circumstances
	leading to the alteration of the secretory function in susceptible
	beta-cells and the onset of diabetes.},

	Due to the differences in conditions and the complexity of the reaction,
	unfolding is not necessarily the reverse of folding. To assess the
	relevance of temperature initiated unfolding studies to the folding
	problem, we compare the folding and unfolding of a 125-residue protein
	model by Monte Carlo dynamics at two temperatures; the lower one
	corresponds to the range used in T -jump experiments and the higher
	one to the range used in unfolding simulations of all-atom models.
	The trajectories that lead from the native state to the denatured
	state at these elevated temperatures are less diverse than those
	observed in the folding simulations. At the lower temperature, the
	system unfolds through a mandatory intermediate that corresponds
	to a local free energy minimum. At the higher temperature, no such
	intermediate is observed, but a similar pathway is followed. The
	structures contributing to the unfolding pathways resemble most closely
	those that make up the "fast track" of folding. The transition state
	for unfolding at the lower temperature (above Tm) is determined and
	is found to be more structured than the transition state for folding
	below the melting temperature. This shift towards the native state
	is consistent with the Hammond postulate. The implications for unfolding
	simulations of higher resolution models and for unfolding experiments
	of proteins are discussed.},

	loops in the polypeptide chain, places one physical limit on the
	speed of protein folding. Many experimental studies have explored
	the kinetics of formation of end-to-end loops in polypeptide chains;
	however, protein folding more often requires the formation of contacts
	between interior points on the chain. One expects that, for loops
	of fixed contour length, interior loops will form more slowly than
	end-to-end loops, owing to the additional excluded volume associated
	with the "tails". We estimate the magnitude of this effect by generating
	ensembles of randomly coiled, freely jointed chains, and then using
	the theory of Szabo, Schulten, and Schulten to calculate the corresponding
	contact formation rates for these ensembles. Adding just a few residues,
	to convert an end-to-end loop to an internal loop, sharply decreases
	the contact rate. Surprisingly, the relative change in rate increases
	for a longer loop; sufficiently long tails, however, actually reverse
	the effect and accelerate loop formation slightly. Our results show
	that excluded volume effects in real, full-length polypeptides may
	cause the rates of loop formation during folding to depart significantly

	applied extensively to study the dynamics of proteins and nucleic
	acids. Here we report the development of a third-generation point-charge
	all-atom force field for proteins. Following the earlier approach
	of Cornell et al., the charge set was obtained by fitting to the
	electrostatic potentials of dipeptides calculated using B3LYP/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G**
	quantum mechanical methods. The main-chain torsion parameters were
	obtained by fitting to the energy profiles of Ace-Ala-Nme and Ace-Gly-Nme
	di-peptides calculated using MP2/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical
	methods. All other parameters were taken from the existing AMBER
	data base. The major departure from previous force fields is that
	all quantum mechanical calculations were done in the condensed phase
	with continuum solvent models and an effective dielectric constant
	of ? = 4. We anticipate that this force field parameter set will
	address certain critical short comings of previous force fields in
	condensed-phase simulations of proteins. Initial tests on peptides
	demonstrated a high-degree of similarity between the calculated and
	the statistically measured Ramanchandran maps for both Ace-Gly-Nme
	and Ace-Ala-Nme di-peptides. Some highlights of our results include
	(1) well-preserved balance between the extended and helical region
	distributions, and (2) favorable type-II poly-proline helical region
	in agreement with recent experiments. Backward compatibility between
	the new and Cornell et al. charge sets, as judged by overall agreement
	between dipole moments, allows a smooth transition to the new force
	field in the area of ligand-binding calculations. Test simulations

	of the same protein. The ability to experimentally perform a large

	analysis used here provides a rigorous statistical method for taking

	the assumption of a prior distribution for parameters over their

	from previous data or from pooling some of the present data. The
	prior distribution is combined with the data to form the posterior
	distribution, which is a compromise between the prior distribution

	we assume that the probability of each rotamer type is dependent
	only on the previous chi rotamer in the chain. For the backbone-dependence
	of the chi 1 rotamers, we derive prior distributions from the product
	of the phi-dependent and psi-dependent probabilities. Molecular mechanics
	calculations with the CHARMM22 potential show a strong similarity
	with the experimental distributions, indicating that proteins attain
	their lowest energy rotamers with respect to local backbone-side-chain

	on the known backbone in test applications for six proteins for which
	high-resolution crystal structures are available. A minimization
	scheme is used to reorient side-chains that conflict with the backbone

	refinement the values range from 61% (lysozyme) to 89% (crambin).
	It is evident from the results that a single protein does not adequately
	test a prediction scheme. The computation time required by the method
	scales linearly with the number of side-chains. An initial prediction
	from the library takes only a few seconds of computer time, while
	the iterative refinement takes on the order of hours. The method
	is automated and can easily be applied to aid experimental side-chain

	The enzyme was rich in both basic and hydrophobic amino acids, presenting

	Amylolytic activity on soluble starch was optimal at pH 5.5-6.0 and

	Calcium enhanced thermostability at temperatures above 80 degrees

	C, 80 min at 90 degrees C, and 19 min at 95 degrees C. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic

	also inhibited by copper and mercuric ions, and p-chloromercuribenzoic

	or Zn<sup>2+</sup>-saturated samples of a cis-vacant montmorillonite
	from Linden, Bavaria, were heated to temperatures between 200-700&deg;C.
	Half of each heated sample was subsequently autoclaved under steam
	at 200&deg;C (approx. 1.5 MPa) to promote rehydroxylation. The smectites
	were characterized by cation-exchange capacity (CEC), determination
	of exchangeable cations, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and thermoanalytical
	investigations of evolved water in a thermobalance linked with a
	mass spectrometer. Changes in the montmorillonite structure and dehydroxylation
	behavior are related to three respective mechanisms: type of the
	interlayer cation, interlayer cation radius, and the movement of
	the interlayer cation. The migration of the smaller Li<sup>+</sup>,
	Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions after heating produces
	a strong reduction of CEC due to the Hofmann-Klemen effect before
	the initiation of dehydroxylation. Thereafter, the CEC of these smectites
	remains constant over a large temperature interval during dehydroxylation.
	After rehydroxylation. Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-rich samples
	release 16-23 meq/100 g of Mg<sup>2-</sup> from the structure. No
	Mg<sup>2+</sup> release is observed for the Li<sup>+</sup>-rich montmorillonite.
	Also the dehyroxylation behavior after rehydroxylation differs between
	the Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>-rich samples. The mass curves
	of the evolved water during thermoanalysis of the rehydroxylated
	Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-rich smectites show a peak doublet
	between 480-700&deg;C. For the Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>,
	and Sr<sup>2+</sup>-rich montmorillonites, the second peak disappeared
	and a third peak at approx. 760&deg;C developed after rehydroxylation.
	The resulting structure after rehydroxylation of all samples is celadonite-like.},

	a variant of the villin headpiece subdomain (HP-35 NleNle). The simulations
	were generated using a new distributed computing method, yielding
	hundreds of trajectories each on a time scale comparable to the experimental
	folding time, despite the large (10,000 atom) size of the simulation
	system. This strategy eliminates the need to assume a two-state kinetic
	model or to build a Markov state model. The relaxation to the folded
	state at 300 K from the unfolded configurations (generated by simulation
	at 373 K) was monitored by a method intended to reflect the experimental
	observable (quenching of tryptophan by histidine). We also monitored
	the relaxation to the native state by directly comparing structural
	snapshots with the native state. The rate of relaxation to the native
	state and the number of resolvable kinetic time scales both depend
	upon starting structure. Moreover, starting structures with folding
	rates most similar to experiment show some native-like structure
	in the N-terminal helix (helix 1) and the phenylalanine residues
	constituting the hydrophobic core, suggesting that these elements
	may exist in the experimentally relevant unfolded state. Our large-scale
	simulation data reveal kinetic complexity not resolved in the experimental
	data. Based on these findings, we propose additional experiments

	receptor, XylF, a component of the high-affinity binding-protein-dependent
	D-xylose transport. The 25-residue N-terminal fragment of the deduced
	T. ethanolicus XylF has typical features of bacterial leader peptides.
	The C-terminal portion of this leader sequence matches the cleavage
	consensus for lipoproteins and is followed by a 22-residue putative
	linker sequence rich in serine, threonine, and asparagine. The putative
	mature 341-amino-acid-residue XylF (calculated molecular mass of

	within the xylAB operon. Unlike in similar transport systems in other
	bacteria, the genes specifying the membrane components (e.g., ATP-binding
	protein and permease) of the high-affinity D-xylose uptake system

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) participate as second messengers in
	the mitogenic signal transduction. Most of the experimental data
	supporting the role of ROS as signaling molecules have been obtained
	by using H2O2. Exposure of cells to H2O2 rapidly increases tyrosine
	phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) in the absence
	of growth factor binding, thus inducing the activation of downstream
	signaling cascades, like that of protein kinase B (AKT). Another
	molecule able to induce an increase of intracellular ROS levels is
	diethylmaleate (DEM), which acts by depleting the ROS scavenger reduced
	glutathione (GSH). A comparison of the effects exerted by H2O2 and
	DEM shows that the latter induces redox modifications milder than
	those generated by H2O2. We also demonstrated that DEM-induced redox
	modifications are not accompanied by platelet-derived growth factor-receptor
	(PDGF-R) and epidermal growth factor-receptor Tyr phosphorylation,
	although they are able to activate ERKs and AKT, with kinetics different
	from those observed following H2O2 treatment. The activation of these
	two pathways is not blocked by AG1296, a selective inhibitor of PDGF-R
	Tyr kinase, thus confirming that the effects of DEM are not mediated
	by the TKR phosphorylation. On the contrary, PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazole[3,4-d]pyrimidine),
	an inhibitor of Src kinase, completely prevents DEM- and H2O2-induced
	AKT activation but has no effect on the pathway of ERKs. Finally,
	nitration of Tyr residues in PDGF-R is observed in DEM-treated cells,
	thus suggesting that ROS-induced modifications different from Tyr
	phosphorylation can occur at the growth factor-receptor level and
	can be involved in the regulation of signaling pathways.},

  abstract = {The estimation of parameters in nonlinear algebraic models through
	the error-in-variables method has been widely studied from a computational
	standpoint. The method involves the minimization of a weighted sum
	of squared errors subject to the model equations. Due to the nonlinear
	nature of the models used, the resulting formulation is nonconvex
	and may contain several local minima in the region of interest. Current
	methods tailored for this formulation, although computationally efficient,
	can only attain convergence to a local solution. In this paper, a
	global optimization approach based on a branch and bound framework
	and convexification techniques for general twice differentiable nonlinear
	optimization problems is proposed for the parameter estimation of
	nonlinear algebraic models. The proposed convexification techniques
	exploit the mathematical properties of the formulation. Classical
	nonlinear estimation problems were solved and will be used to illustrate
	the various theoretical and computational aspects of the proposed
	approach.},

  abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are membrane-anchored
	heterodimers that present antigenic peptides to T cells. Expression
	of these molecules in soluble form has met limited success, presumably
	due to their large size, heterodimeric structure and the presence
	of multiple disulfide bonds. Here we have used directed evolution
	and yeast surface display to engineer soluble single-chain human
	lymphocyte antigen (HLA) class II MHC DR1 molecules without covalently
	attached peptides (scDR1alphabeta). Specifically, a library of mutant
	scDR1alphabeta molecules was generated by random mutagenesis and
	screened by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) with DR-specific
	conformation-sensitive antibodies, yielding three well-expressed
	and properly folded scDR1alphabeta variants displayed on the yeast
	cell surface. Detailed analysis of these evolved variants and a few
	site-directed mutants generated de novo indicated three amino acid
	residues in the beta1 domain are important for the improved protein
	folding yield. Further, molecular modeling studies suggested these
	mutations might increase the protein folding efficiency by improving
	the packing of a hydrophobic core in the alpha1beta1 domain of DR1.
	The scDR1alphabeta mutants displayed on the yeast cell surface are
	remarkably stable and bind specifically to DR-specific peptide HA(306-318)
	with high sensitivity and rapid kinetics in flow cytometric assays.
	Moreover, since the expression, stability and peptide-binding properties
	of these mutants can be directly assayed on the yeast cell surface
	using immuno-fluorescence labeling and flow cytometry, time-consuming
	purification and refolding steps of recombinant DR1 molecules are
	eliminated. Therefore, these scDR1alphabeta molecules will provide
	a powerful technology platform for further design of DR1 molecules
	with improved peptide-binding specificity and affinity for therapeutic
	and diagnostic applications. The methods described here should be
	generally applicable to other class II MHC molecules and also class
	I MHC molecules for their functional expression, characterization
	and engineering.},

	Here we examine intermediates along the 'lineage' from a naturally

	P450 propane monooxygenase (P450PMO) having 20 heme domain substitutions

	contrast, refinement of the enzyme catalytic efficiency for propane
	oxidation (approximately 9000-fold increase in kcat/Km) involves
	profound reshaping and partitioning of the substrate access pathway.
	Remodeling of the substrate-recognition mechanisms ultimately results
	in remarkable narrowing of the substrate profile around propane and

	we have examined the role of acetylated COX-2 and 5-LOX in modulating
	antiadhesive effects of aspirin on adhesion of PMN to endotoxin (LPS)-primed
	human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC). (3) Treating PMN/HUVEC
	cocultures with aspirin resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition
	of cell-to-cell adhesion induced by LPS. Treating HUVEC with selective
	COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib, caused an approximately
	70% reversion of antiadhesive effect of aspirin. In contrast, inhibition
	of neutrophil's 5-LOX pathway with 1 micro M ZD2138, a selective
	5-LOX inhibitor, 1 micro M BAY-X-1005, a FLAP inhibitor, or 100 micro
	M licofelone, a dual COX/5-LOX inhibitor, did not affect antiadhesive
	properties of aspirin. (4) Exposure to celecoxib (100 micro M) or
	rofecoxib (10 micro M) completely suppressed ATL formation caused
	by aspirin without affecting LTB(4) levels. ZD2138, licofelone and
	BAY-X-1005 inhibited ATL formation as well as LTB(4) generation.
	(5) Treatment with LXA(4) reduced PMN adhesion to HUVEC and counteracted
	the proadhesive effect of celecoxib. In contrast, exposure to Boc-1,
	an LXA(4) antagonist, counteracts the antiadhesive activities of
	aspirin. Exposure to U75302, an LTB(4) receptor antagonist, enhances
	the antiadesive effect of aspirin. (6) Reversal of antiadhesive activities
	of aspirin by celecoxib was associated with increased expression
	of LFA-1 on PMN and E-selectin on HUVEC. Addition of LXA(4), ZD2138
	and U75302 inhibited these changes. (7) The present results support
	the notion that inhibition of ATL formation is mechanistically linked
	to the reversal of the antiadhesive activity of aspirin caused by
	selective COX-1 inhibitors and suggests that the LTB(4)/ATL balance
	modulates pro- and antiadhesive activity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
	drugs at the leukocyte-endothelial cell interface.},

  abstract = {A detailed mechanism for the catalysis of prolyl isomerization by

	from the known structure of the FK506/FKBP complex. The model substrate
	is bound as a type VIa proline turn with the ends exposed to permit
	longer polypeptide chains (e.g., protein loops) to act as substrates.
	An ab initio potential for the isomerized imide bond is combined
	with a molecular mechanics representation of the rest of the system
	to calculate the reaction path. The resulting activation energy for
	the enzymatic cis-->trans isomerization is equal to about 6 kcal/mol,
	in good agreement with experiment. The lowering of the barrier relative
	to the solution value of 19 kcal/mol is found to arise from a combination
	of desolvation of the imide carbonyl, ground-state destabilization,
	substrate autocatalysis, and preferential transition-state binding.
	Minimal rearrangements are required in the enzyme and the substrate
	along the reaction path. The enzyme residues that participate in
	catalysis agree with the available mutation data. The type VIa turn
	model corresponds to a sequence-specific structural motif commonly
	found on the surface of proteins. It is likely to have a role in

	intermediate in which the A-strand is detached. The structure and

	A conservative destabilising mutation in the A-strand has no effect
	on the unfolding force, nor the dependence of the unfolding force
	on the pulling speed, indicating that the unfolding forces measured
	in an AFM experiment are those required for the unfolding of the
	intermediate and not the native state. A mutant of TI I27 with the
	A-strand deleted (TI I27-A) is studied by NMR and standard biophysical
	techniques, combined with protein engineering. Molecular dynamics
	simulations show TI I27-A to be a good model for the intermediate.
	It has a structure very similar to the native state, and is surprisingly
	stable. Comparison with a Phi-value analysis of the unfolding pathway
	clearly shows that the protein unfolds by a different pathway under
	an applied force than on addition of denaturant.},

  abstract = {Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) was the first flavoenzyme discovered, and
	has been widely used as a model flavoenzyme. Three crystal forms
	have been grown from natural protease-nicked OYE and one has been
	grown from intact recombinant OYE. The recombinant OYE crystals are
	best suited for structure determination and grow from a solution
	containing polyethylene glycol and MgCl2. They belong to space group
	P4(3)2(1)2 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 142.88 A, c = 43.01
	A and have a single OYE chain per asymmetric unit. In order to optimize
	the production of large single crystals, we have carried out a systematic
	study of crystal size versus drop volume. Crystallographic lore holds
	that the volume of the medium in which the crystals are grown should
	have a significant effect on the final size of the crystals produced.
	However, a systematic investigation of the degree to which the volume
	of the crystallization sample affects the final size of the crystals
	has not been reported. In order to investigate this phenomenon, drops
	were set up in both hanging and sandwich geometry at a variety of
	drop volumes, but otherwise identical crystallization conditions.
	A 60-fold increase in drop volume produced a 730-fold increase in
	crystal volume, and a simultaneous increase in the effective diffraction
	limit of the crystals from near 2.5 A to well beyond 2.0 A resolution.
	The dramatic crystal volume increase appears to be due both to the
	increased amount of protein and the slower equilibration rates associated
	with larger drops. Our results also emphasize that the quality of
	diffraction data may often be limited by crystal size rather than
	intrinsic crystal order even in the case of reasonably sized (200
	to 400 microns) crystals.},

	which revealed a stoichiometry of one molecule of mesoporphyrin bound
	per protein monomer. The binding is strongly exothermic, with a large
	intrinsic enthalpy (DeltaH=-97.1 kJ x mol(-1)), and is associated
	with the uptake of two protons from the buffer. This proton transfer
	suggests that hydrogen bonding between ferrochelatase and mesoporphyrin
	is a key factor in the thermodynamics of the binding reaction. Differential
	scanning calorimetry thermograms indicated a co-operative two-state
	denaturation process with a single transition temperature of 56 degrees
	C for wild-type murine ferrochelatase. An increase in the thermal
	stability of ferrochelatase is dependent upon mesoporphyrin binding.
	Similarly, murine ferrochelatase variants, in which the active site
	Glu-289 was replaced by either glutamine or alanine and, when purified,
	contained specifically-bound protoporphyrin, exhibited enhanced protein
	stability when compared with wild-type ferrochelatase. However, in

	includes more than 100 proteins and polypeptides derived from open
	reading frames translated from DNA sequences. Members of this family
	are widely distributed and have been found in the gamma subgroup
	of the proteobacteria, low- and high-G + C-content gram-positive
	bacteria, and cyanobacteria. These proteins are defined by a profile
	that can be accessed from PROSITE PS01124. Members of the family
	are about 300 amino acids long and have three main regulatory functions
	in common: carbon metabolism, stress response, and pathogenesis.
	Multiple alignments of the proteins of the family define a conserved
	stretch of 99 amino acids usually located at the C-terminal region
	of the regulator and connected to a nonconserved region via a linker.
	The conserved stretch contains all the elements required to bind
	DNA target sequences and to activate transcription from cognate promoters.
	Secondary analysis of the conserved region suggests that it contains
	two potential alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix DNA binding motifs. The
	first, and better-fitting motif is supported by biochemical data,
	whereas existing biochemical data neither support nor refute the
	proposal that the second region possesses this structure. The phylogenetic
	relationship suggests that members of the family have recruited the
	nonconserved domain(s) into a series of existing domains involved
	in DNA recognition and transcription stimulation and that this recruited
	domain governs the role that the regulator carries out. For some
	regulators, it has been demonstrated that the nonconserved region
	contains the dimerization domain. For the regulators involved in
	carbon metabolism, the effector binding determinants are also in
	this region. Most regulators belonging to the AraC/XylS family recognize
	multiple binding sites in the regulated promoters. One of the motifs
	usually overlaps or is adjacent to the -35 region of the cognate
	promoters. Footprinting assays have suggested that these regulators
	protect a stretch of up to 20 bp in the target promoters, and multiple
	alignments of binding sites for a number of regulators have shown
	that the proteins recognize short motifs within the protected region.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An important prerequisite for computational structure-based
	drug design is prediction of the structures of ligand-protein complexes
	that have not yet been experimentally determined by X-ray crystallography
	or NMR. For this task, docking of rigid ligands is inadequate because
	it assumes knowledge of the conformation of the bound ligand. Docking
	of flexible ligands would be desirable, but requires one to search
	an enormous conformational space. We set out to develop a strategy
	for flexible docking by combining a simple model of ligand-protein
	interactions for molecular recognition with an evolutionary programming
	search technique. RESULTS: We have developed an intermolecular energy
	function that incorporates steric and hydrogen-bonding terms. The
	parameters in this function were obtained by docking in three different
	protein systems. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated
	by conformationally flexible docking of the inhibitor AG-1343, a
	potential new drug against AIDS, into HIV-1 protease. For this molecule,
	which has nine rotatable bonds, the crystal structure was reproduced
	within 1.5 A root-mean-square deviation 34 times in 100 simulations,
	each requiring eight minutes on a Silicon Graphics R4400 workstation.
	The energy function correctly evaluates the crystal structure as
	the global energy minimum. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that a solution
	of the docking problem may be achieved by matching a simple model
	of molecular recognition with an efficient search procedure. The
	necessary ingredients of a molecular recognition model include only
	steric and hydrogen-bond interaction terms. Although these terms
	are not necessarily sufficient to predict binding affinity, they
	describe ligand-protein interactions faithfully enough to enable
	a docking program to predict the structure of the bound ligand. This
	docking strategy thus provides an important tool for the interdisciplinary
	field of rational drug design.},

	The potentials are analyzed to determine the roles and relative importance

	structural characteristics of the side chains determine two major
	patterns of energy surfaces, E(X1,X2): a gamma-branched pattern and

	to being fast, their kinetics is unusual. Like traditional rate processes,
	fast folding proteins have activation barriers at low temperatures,
	but unlike traditional processes, they have negative activation energies
	at high temperatures. We develop a model of ultrafast folders that
	joins a macroscopic mass-action model with a microscopic energy landscape
	description; we call it the Thruway Search Model. We find good agreement
	with experimental rates and equilibria on 13 ultrafast folders. The
	observed folding rates are found to be proportional to the number
	of microscopic folding routes: fast-folding proteins have more parallel
	microscopic routes on energy landscapes. At high temperatures, where
	traditional barriers are small, the remaining bottleneck is a search
	through denatured conformations to find thruway routes to the native
	state. Negative activation arises because increasing temperature
	expands the denatured ensemble, broadening the search, slowing the
	folding to the native state. We find that the upper estimate of the
	free energy barriers are positive but small, as little as 0.5 kT.},

	been considered in a number of theoretical papers, few methods of
	computing binding affinities are derived explicitly from this underlying
	theory. This has contributed to uncertainty and controversy in certain
	areas. This article therefore reviews and extends the connections
	of some important computational methods with the underlying statistical
	thermodynamics. A derivation of the standard free energy of binding
	forms the basis of this review. This derivation should be useful
	in formulating novel computational methods for predicting binding
	affinities. It also permits several important points to be established.
	For example, it is found that the double-annihilation method of computing
	binding energy does not yield the standard free energy of binding,
	but can be modified to yield this quantity. The derivation also makes
	it possible to define clearly the changes in translational, rotational,
	configurational, and solvent entropy upon binding. It is argued that
	molecular mass has a negligible effect upon the standard free energy
	of binding for biomolecular systems, and that the cratic entropy
	defined by Gurney is not a useful concept. In addition, the use of
	continuum models of the solvent in binding calculations is reviewed,

	The beta structural class of proteins was found to be the leader,

	the regular secondary structure is the largest, and second, the accessible
	surface area of packaged elements of the beta-structure increases
	more rapidly with increasing molecular mass in comparison with the

	optimization. It is one of deciding where to locate a set of plants
	so that a set of clients can be supplied by them at the minimum cost.
	This problem often appears as a subproblem in other combinatorial
	problems. Several branch and bound techniques have been developed
	to solve these problems. In this paper we present two techniques
	that enhance the performance of branch and bound algorithms. The
	new algorithms thus obtained are called branch and peg algorithms,
	where pegging refers to fixing values of variables at each subproblem
	in the branch and bound tree, and is distinct from variable fixing
	during the branching process. We present exhaustive computational
	experiments which show that the new algorithms generate less than
	60% of the number of subproblems generated by branch and bound algorithms,
	and in certain cases require less than 10% of the execution times
	required by branch and bound algorithms. Scope and purpose. Locational
	decision problems of choosing the location of facilities to satisfy
	the demand of a set of clients at minimum costs constitute a very
	important class of practical problems. The simple plant location
	problem is a subclass of such problems, in which the facilities are
	supposed to have infinite capacities. These problems are used to
	model, among others, bank account location problems and in cluster
	analysis (refer, for example, to Cornuejols et al., in Discrete Location
	Theory, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1990, p. 119) and also, in
	recent times, to problems related to electronic business (refer to
	Fourer and Goux, Interfaces 31 (2001) 130). Not only are these problems
	important in themselves, but they also appear as subproblems in a
	much wider class of combinatorial problems, for example in crew scheduling,
	vehicle despatching, assortment, etc. The simple plant location problem
	is NP-Hard and there is much research on good algorithms for these
	problems. Effective solution techniques based on branch and bound
	algorithms have been suggested in the literature. In this paper we
	suggest techniques that substantially reduce the execution times
	of such algorithms. We think that these techniques can be used to
	enhance the performance of almost all the available solution algorithms
	for this problem. We hope that this paper will motivate research
	to apply the techniques suggested here to other problems},

	macular degeneration to evaluate the efficacy of newly designed peptide
	inhibitors of the complement system. The peptides belong to the compstatin

	to promote binding to their target, complement protein C3, and to
	enhance solubility by improving their polarity/hydrophobicity ratios.
	Based on analysis of molecular dynamics simulation data of peptide-C3
	complexes, novel binding features were designed by introducing intermolecular
	salt bridge-forming arginines at the N-terminus and at position -1
	of N-terminal dipeptide extensions. Our study demonstrates that the

  abstract = {A molecule can enter a zeolite channel when it fits the size and shape
	of the opening. Zeolites have been used commercially for their ability
	to admit selectively molecule A but not molecule B. The search and
	design of zeolites for separation has been based on finding a channel
	with a diameter that is larger than molecule A, but smaller than
	molecule B. This method is not sufficiently accurate when the molecule
	is not a sphere or the channel is not a circle. We present here first
	a more accurate screening method based on comparing both the major
	and minor diameters of the molecule projection, called the "footprint",
	with the diameters of the channel. Then we present an even better
	method that is based on the activation energy required to strain
	and distort a molecule to fit a given channel, thus leading to a
	lowering of its Boltzmann concentration in this channel. This paper
	compiles the activation energies encountered among thirty-eight (38)
	molecules and two hundred and seventeen (217) zeolite channels into
	a database, and shows how one can use this database to identify the
	most promising zeolites for the separation of a set of molecules
	of interest. Such a screening method would help to identify a zeolite
	that has much lower activation energy for molecule A than for molecule
	B. The appropriate temperature range for separation would be centered
	around the optimal temperature T*, where the degree of selectivity
	is at a maximum. The separation of the three pentane molecules was
	selected as an illustration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	exclusion limit lower than the molecular mass of the protein to be
	refolded. A limited sample volume of the protein, dissolved in the
	highest denaturant concentration at the lowest pH of the selected
	gradient combination, is applied to the column. During the course
	of elution, the zone of denatured protein moves down the column at
	a speed approximately threefold higher than that of the denaturant.
	This means that the protein sample will gradually pass through areas
	of increasingly lower denaturant concentrations and higher pH, which
	promotes refolding into the native conformation. The shape and slope
	of the gradients, as well as the flow rate, will influence the refolding
	rate and can be adjusted for different protein samples. The principle
	is illustrated using a denatured recombinant scFv fusion protein
	obtained from E. coli inclusion bodies.},

	are accepted or rejected based on the improvement in the alignment

	structural families show promising results, the score increases by
	69% on average. The increase in score is accompanied by an increase

	Two specific families, protein kinases and aspartic proteinases were

	Three 25-ps molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K of the bovine

	are compared: one of BPTI in vacuo, one of BPTI in a box with 2647
	spherical nonpolar solvent atoms, and one of BPTI surrounded by fixed
	crystal image atoms. Both average and time-dependent molecular properties
	are examined to determine the effect of the environment on the behavior
	of the protein. The dynamics of BPTI in solution or in the crystal
	environment are found to be very similar to that found in the vacuum
	calculation. The primary difference in the average properties is
	that the equilibrium structure in the presence of solvent or the
	crystal field is significantly closer to the X-ray structure than
	is the vacuum result; concomitantly, the more realistic environment
	leads to a number density closer to experiment. The presence of solvent
	has a negligible effect on the overall magnitude of the positional
	or dihedral angle fluctuations in the interior of the protein; however,
	there are changes in the decay times of the fluctuations of interior
	atoms. For surface residues, both the magnitude and the time course
	of the motions are significantly altered by the solvent. There tends
	to be an increase in the displacements of long side chains and the
	flexible parts of the main chain that protrude into the solvent.
	Further, these motions tend to have a more diffusive character with
	longer relaxation times than in vacuo. The crystal environment has
	a specific effect on a number of side chains which are held in relatively

	the neighboring protein atoms. Most of the effects of the solution

	time-series data and show how the inferred network topology can be
	linked to sequence-level information hard-wired in the organism's
	genome. We propose a systematic way for determining the correlation
	threshold at which two genes are assessed to be co-expressed using
	the clustering coefficient and we expand the scope of the gene co-expression
	network by proposing the slope ratio metric as a means for incorporating
	directionality on the edges. We show through specific examples for
	B. subtilis that by incorporating expression level information in
	addition to the temporal expression patterns, we can uncover sequence-level
	biological insights. In particular, we are able to identify a number
	of cases where (1) the co-expressed genes are part of a single transcriptional
	unit or operon and (2) the inferred directionality arises due to
	the presence of intra-operon transcription termination sites. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {This article introduces MMFF94, the initial published version of the
	Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set
	for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it
	applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing
	MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational
	and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94
	differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase
	processes in molecular-dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks
	to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small molecules in a combined "organic/protein"
	force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems
	of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that
	the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality
	computational data - ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the
	HF/6-31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level,
	380 MP2/6-31G* structures evaluated at a defined approximation to
	the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G*
	geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing
	feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety
	of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial chemists,
	including many that feature frequently occurring combinations of
	functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental data
	are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents
	a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the common "functional
	group" approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been determined
	in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational
	data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization
	very well. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths
	(0.014 A root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2&deg; rms), vibrational
	frequencies (61 cm<sup>-1</sup> rms), conformational energies (0.38
	kcal/mol rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly
	as well as does MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes
	intermolecular interactions in hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that
	closely parallels that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field.

	(i) [similar to] 250 comparisons of conformational energy based on
	"MP4SDQ/TZP" calculations (triple-zeta plus polarization calculations
	at a defined approximation to the highly correlated MP4SDQ level)

	of "torsion profile" structures at geometries derived from MP2/6-31G*

	fits that used the complete set of available computational data,

	computational data with root mean square (rms) deviations of 0.31

	28 experimentally determined rotational barriers with a rms deviation
	of 0.39 kcal/mol. Given the diverse nature of the experimental conformational
	energies and rotational barriers and the clear indications of experimental
	error in some cases, the MMFF94 results appear excellent. Nevertheless,
	MMFF94 encounters somewhat greater difficulty in handling multifunctional
	compounds that place highly polar functional groups in close proximity,
	probably because it, like other commonly used force fields, too greatly
	simplifies the description of electrostatic interactions. Some suggestions

  abstract = {Many fatal neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s, Parkinson,

	as type II diabetes are characterized by abnormal amyloid fiber aggregates,
	suggesting a common mechanism of pathogenesis. We have discovered
	that a class of systematically designed natural tri- to hexapeptides
	with a characteristic sequential motif can simulate the process of
	fiber assembly and further condensation to amyloid fibrils, probably
	via unexpected dimeric ?-helical intermediate structures. The characteristic
	sequence motif of the novel peptide class consists of an aliphatic
	amino acid tail of decreasing hydrophobicity capped by a polar head.
	To our knowledge, the investigated aliphatic tripeptides are the
	shortest ever reported naturally occurring amino acid sequence that
	can adopt ?-helical structure and promote amyloid formation. We propose
	the stepwise assembly process to be associated with characteristic
	conformational changes from random coil to ?-helical intermediates
	terminating in cross-? peptide structures. Circular dichroism and
	X-ray fiber diffraction analyses confirmed the concentration-dependent
	conformational changes of the peptides in water. Molecular dynamics
	simulating peptide behavior in water revealed monomer antiparallel
	pairing to dimer structures by complementary structural alignment
	that further aggregated and stably condensed into coiled fibers.
	The ultrasmall size and the dynamic facile assembly process make
	this novel peptide class an excellent model system for studying the
	mechanism of amyloidogenesis, its evolution and pathogenicity. The
	ability to modify the properties of the assembled structures under
	defined conditions will shed light on strategies to manipulate the
	pathogenic amyloid aggregates in order to prevent or control aggregate

	The designed double mutant, N68C/A93C, in which the surface residues
	Asn68 and Ala93 were replaced by cysteines, formed dimers in solution
	and crystallized isomorphously to wild-type, but at a much faster

	was also used to obtain crystals in a different space group of a

	results suggest that the formation of the lysozyme dimer is a critical
	intermediate in the formation of more than one crystal form and that
	covalent cross-linking of the intermediate accelerates nucleation
	and facilitates crystal growth. The disulfide cross-links are located
	on the 'back' of the molecule and formation of the cross-linked dimer
	appears to leave the active sites completely unobstructed. Nevertheless,
	the cross-linked dimer is completely inactive. One explanation for
	this behavior is that the disulfide bridges prevent hinge-bending

	which builds new ligand binding sites into a protein of known three-dimensional
	structure. It alters only the sequence and the side-chain structure

	The program searches for a constellation of backbone positions arranged
	such that if appropriate side-chains were placed there, they would
	bind the ligand according to a pre-defined geometry of interaction
	specified by the experimentalist. These binding sites are introduced
	by the program by taking into account simple rules such as steric
	hindrance, atomic close-packing and hydrogen bond patterns, which
	are known to maintain the integrity of a protein structure to a first
	approximation. A test case is presented in this paper where the copper
	binding site found in blue-copper proteins such as plastocyanin,
	azurin and cupredoxin is introduced into Escherichia coli thioredoxin.
	The model building of one of the solutions found by the program is
	presented in some detail. The experimental construction and properties
	of this new protein are described in an accompanying paper. It is
	hoped that this program provides a general method for the design
	of ligand binding sites and enzyme active sites, which can then be

	genome stability[1-6]. RNA interference(RNAi) involves short double-stranded
	RNA (21-23 nucleotides long), termed short interference RNA(siRNA),
	resulting in the downregulation of genes with cognate sequences [7-9].
	During transient siRNA-induced RNAi in mouse fibroblast cultures,
	we found significant reversible changes related to the telomeres.
	Telomeres acquired distinct heterochromatin features. There were
	increased bindings of Argonaute-1 (AGO1), telomeric repeat-binding
	factor 1(TERF1), and heterochromatin protein 1beta (HP1beta) on the
	telomeres. Histone H3 (lysine 9) was hypermethylated at the telomeres.
	The chromosome ends also were associated with an unidentified RNA.
	During RNAi, expression of a transgene inserted adjacent to the telomere
	was downregulated. In addition, the concentration of a group of heterogeneous
	high-molecular-weight RNA containing telomeric repeat sequences was
	increased, and this RNA formed a small number of transient, discrete
	nuclear foci. Our findings suggest that telomeres participate actively
	in the siRNA-induced RNAi process. These responses of telomeres to
	the RNAi process might partially account for the off-target effects
	of RNAi.},

	in MACiE is fully annotated so that it includes the function of the
	catalytic residues involved in the reaction and the mechanism by
	which substrates are transformed into products. Using MACiE as a
	knowledge base, we have seen that the top 10 most catalytic residues
	are histidine, aspartate, glutamate, lysine, cysteine, arginine,
	serine, threonine, tyrosine and tryptophan. Of these only seven (cysteine,
	histidine, aspartate, lysine, serine, threonine and tyrosine) dominate

	essential. Stabilisation is the most common and essential role for
	all classes of enzyme, followed by general acid/base (proton acceptor
	and proton donor) functionality, with nucleophilic addition following
	closely behind (nucleophile and nucleofuge). We investigated the
	occurrence of these residues in MACiE and the Catalytic Site Atlas
	and found that, as expected, certain residue types are associated
	with each functional role, with some residue types able to perform
	diverse roles. In addition, it was seen that different EC classes
	of enzyme have a tendency to employ different residues for catalysis.
	Further, we show that whilst the differences between EC classes in
	catalytic residue composition are not immediately obvious from the
	general classes of Ingold mechanisms, there is some weak correlation
	between the mechanisms involved in a given EC class and the functions
	that the catalytic amino acid residues are performing. The analysis
	presented here provides a valuable insight into the functional roles
	of catalytic amino acid residues, which may have applications in

	chemical grafting and physical adsorption of PVA endow stability
	of the polystyrene particles. Such a mechanism was justified from
	the FT-IR spectrum of polystyrene particles in which characteristic
	peaks of PVA molecules are witnessed. The molecular weight increases
	with the PVA content due to the reduced particle size. The glass
	transition temperatures of the polystyrene particles lie in 98.9-104.4

	extensive use and testing, limitations in this force field, such
	as over-stabilization of ?-helices, were reported by us and other

	resulting in a variety of â€œAmberâ€? force fields and significant
	difficulty in determining which should be used for a particular application.
	We show that several of these continue to suffer from inadequate
	balance between different secondary structure elements. In addition,
	the approach used in most of these studies neglected to account for
	the existence in Amber of two sets of backbone ?/? dihedral terms.
	This led to parameter sets that provide unreasonable conformational
	preferences for glycine. We report here an effort to improve the

	are based on fitting the energies of multiple conformations of glycine

  abstract = {The human mitochondrial NAD(P)(+)-dependent malic enzyme (m-NAD-ME)
	is a malic enzyme isoform with dual cofactor specificity and substrate
	binding cooperativity. Previous kinetic studies have suggested that
	Lys(362) in the pigeon cytosolic NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme has
	remarkable effects on the binding of NADP(+) to the enzyme and on
	the catalytic power of the enzyme (Kuo, C. C., Tsai, L. C., Chin,
	T. Y., Chang, G.-G., and Chou, W. Y. (2000) Biochem. Biophys. Res.
	Commun. 270, 821-825). In this study, we investigate the important
	role of Gln(362) in the transformation of cofactor specificity from
	NAD(+) to NADP(+) in human m-NAD-ME. Our kinetic data clearly indicate
	that the Q362K mutant shifted its cofactor preference from NAD(+)
	to NADP(+). The K-m(NADP) and k(cat(NADP)) values for this mutant
	were reduced by 4-6-fold and increased by 5-10-fold, respectively,
	compared with those for the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, up to
	a 2-fold reduction in Km(NADP)/Km(NAD) and elevation of k(cat(NADP))/k(cat(NAD))
	were observed for the Q362K enzyme. Mutation of Gln(362) to Ala or
	Asn did not shift its cofactor preference. The K-m(NADP)/K-m(NAD)
	and k(cat(NADP))/k(cat(NAD)) values for Q362A and Q362N were comparable
	with those for the wild-type enzyme. The Delta G values for Q362A
	and Q362N with either NAD(+) or NADP(+) were positive, indicating
	that substitution of Gln with Ala or Asn at position 362 brings about
	unfavorable cofactor binding at the active site and thus significantly
	reduces the catalytic efficiency. Our data also indicate that the
	cooperative binding of malate became insignificant in human m-NAD-ME
	upon mutation of Gln(362) to Lys because the sigmoidal phenomenon
	appearing in the wildtype enzyme was much less obvious that that
	in Q362K. Therefore, mutation of Gln(362) to Lys in human m-NAD-ME
	alters its kinetic properties of cofactor preference, malate binding
	cooperativity, and allosteric regulation by fumarate. However, the
	other Gln(362) mutants, Q362A and Q362N, have conserved malate binding
	cooperativity and NAD(+) specificity. In this study, we provide clear
	evidence that the single mutation of Gln(362) to Lys in human m-NAD-ME
	changes it to an NADP(+)-dependent enzyme, which is characteristic
	because it is non-allosteric, non-cooperative, and NADP(+)-specific.},

	reductase (5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate: NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3)
	has been studied by a combination of site-specific mutagenesis and
	reaction kinetics. Studies suggest that the overall protein structure
	and kinetic sequence for the reaction did not change for the mutant
	proteins compared to the wild-type enzyme. Two sets of mutated reductases
	have been constructed. The first set, in which the side chains of
	the targeted amino acids are spatially well separated (approximately
	8 A), includes two single mutants (L28Y and L54F) and a double mutant
	(L28Y-L54F). This set features residues that increased the side chain
	surface area and the potential for substrate interactions. Unexpectedly,
	nonadditivity in the free energy changes for the thermodynamics of
	ligand binding and in the rates of hydride transfer and product release
	is observed. The progressive increase in dihydrofolate binding is
	reversed for the sterically more crowded double mutant, with delta
	delta G ca. 3 kcal mol-1 less favorable than anticipated. On the
	other hand, the decrease in the rate constant for hydride transfer
	noted with the single mutants relative to the wild-type enzyme is
	reversed for the double mutant, so that delta delta G not equal to
	is ca. 2 kcal mol-1 more favorable. The second set of mutant proteins
	includes two double mutants (L28A-F31A and I50A-L54G) in which the
	selected amino acids are separated by three to four intervening amino
	acids and a quadruple mutant (L28A-F31A-I50A-L54G) in which the two
	sets L28A-F31A and I50A-L54G are spatially distinct. This set deleted
	the side chain surface area to lower the opportunity for substrate
	interactions. Nonadditivity in the free energy changes associated
	with key kinetic and thermodynamic parameters is again observed.
	The decrease in dihydrofolate binding found with the two double mutants
	is not observed with the quadruple mutant, which binds the substrate
	with delta delta G ca. 6.5 kcal mol-1 more favorable than expected.
	Similarly, the quadruple mutant has a larger rate constant for hydride
	transfer (-delta delta G not equal to congruent to 1.7 kcal mol-1)
	than predicted. One interpretation for the nonadditivity is that
	these residues interact through binding of the folate substrate,
	which serves to link molecularly remote side chain moieties within
	the active site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The enantioselective reduction of carbonyl groups is of interest for
	the production of various chiral compounds such as hydroxy acids,
	amino acids, hydroxy esters, or alcohols. Such products have high
	economic value and are most interesting as additives for food and
	feed or as building blocks for organic synthesis. Enzymatic reactions
	or biotransformations with whole cells (growing or resting) for this
	purpose are described. Although conversions with whole cells are
	advantageous with respect to saving expensive isolation of the desired
	enzymes, the products often lack high enantiomeric excess and the
	process results in low time-space-yield. For the synthesis of chiral
	alcohols, only lab-scale syntheses with commercially available alcohol
	dehydrogenases have been described yet. However, most of these enzymes
	are of limited use for technical applications because they lack substrate
	specificity, stability (yeast ADH) or enantioselectivity (Thermoanaerobium
	brockii ADH). Furthermore, all enzymes so far described are forming
	(S)-alcohols. Quite recently, we found and characterized several
	new bacterial alcohol dehydrogenases, which are suited for the preparation
	of chiral alcohols as well as for hydroxy esters in technical scale.
	Remarkably, of all these novel ADHs the (R)-specific enzymes were
	found in strains of the genus Lactobacillus. Meanwhile, these new
	enzymes were characterized extensively. Protein data (amino acid
	sequence, bound cations) confirm that these catalysts are novel enzymes.
	(R)-specific as well as (S)-specific ADHs accept a broad variety
	of ketones and ketoesters as substrates. The applicability of alcohol
	dehydrogenases for chiral syntheses as an example for the technical
	use of coenzyme-dependent enzymes is demonstrated and discussed in
	this contribution. In particular NAD-dependent enzymes coupled with
	the coenzyme regeneration by formate dehydrogenase proved to be economically
	feasible for the production of fine chemicals.},

	recast the calculation of the self-electrostatic solvation energy
	to utilize a simple smoothing function at the dielectric boundary.
	The present GB model is formulated in this manner to provide consistency
	with the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory previously developed to yield
	numerically stable electrostatic solvation forces based on finite-difference
	methods (W. Im, D. Beglov, and B. Roux, Comp Phys Commun 1998, 111,

	efficient and accurate approach to reproduce corresponding PB solvation
	energies and forces. With only two adjustable parameters--a(0) to
	modulate the Coulomb field term, and a(1) to include a correction
	term beyond Coulomb field--the PB solvation energies are reproduced
	within 1% error on average for a variety of proteins. Detailed analysis
	shows that the PB energy can be reproduced within 2% absolute error
	with a confidence of about 95%. In addition, the solvent-exposed
	surface area of a biomolecule, as commonly used in calculations of
	the nonpolar solvation energy, can be calculated accurately and efficiently
	using the simple smoothing function and the volume integration method.
	Our implicit solvent GB calculations are about 4.5 times slower than
	the corresponding vacuum calculations. Using the simple smoothing
	function makes the present GB model roughly three times faster than
	GB models, which attempt to mimic the Lee-Richards molecular volume.},

	In this work, a reactive scheduling framework is developed which
	utilizes an efficient mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) mathematical
	framework developed for short-term scheduling problems with modifications
	introduced to reflect the effects of the unforeseen event. To avoid
	full rescheduling of the current production horizon, the formulation
	determines tasks which are not affected by the unforeseen event,
	either directly or indirectly, and can be carried out as scheduled.
	The resulting tasks along with additional subsets of tasks are then
	fixed in the MILP problem, and the rest of the horizon is rescheduled.
	We consider two types of unexpected events: unit shutdown and the
	addition or modification of orders. Both cases utilize the nominal
	schedules, the original MILP formulation for short-term scheduling
	with modifications, and a program to determine which tasks may be
	fixed before rescheduling. The formulation is then able to determine

	uncertainty described by a known probability distribution. This robust
	optimization formulation is based on a min-max framework and when
	applied to mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems, produces
	"robust" solutions that are immune against data uncertainty. Uncertainty
	is considered in the coefficients of the objective function, as well

	developed for uncertain data described by several known distributions
	including a uniform distribution, a normal distribution, the difference
	of two normal distributions, a general discrete distribution, a binomial
	distribution, and a poisson distribution. The robust optimization
	formulation introduces a small number of auxiliary variables and

	the proton affinity of the alcohol and the stability of the carbenium-ion
	transition state. Changes in the central and addenda atoms of the
	POM cluster and the presence of n-donors, a support, vicinal POM
	clusters, or charge-compensating cations were found to lead to changes

  abstract = {The aldo-keto reductases metabolize a wide range of substrates and
	are potential drug targets. This protein superfamily includes aldose
	reductases, aldehyde reductases, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and
	dihydrodiol dehydrogenases. By combining multiple sequence alignments
	with known three-dimensional structures and the results of site-directed
	mutagenesis studies, we have developed a structure/function analysis
	of this superfamily. Our studies suggest that the (alpha/beta)8-barrel
	fold provides a common scaffold for an NAD(P)(H)-dependent catalytic
	activity, with substrate specificity determined by variation of loops
	on the C-terminal side of the barrel. All the aldo-keto reductases
	are dependent on nicotinamide cofactors for catalysis and retain
	a similar cofactor binding site, even among proteins with less than
	30% amino acid sequence identity. Likewise, the aldo-keto reductase
	active site is highly conserved. However, our alignments indicate
	that variation ofa single residue in the active site may alter the
	reaction mechanism from carbonyl oxidoreduction to carbon-carbon
	double-bond reduction, as in the 3-oxo-5beta-steroid 4-dehydrogenases
	(Delta4-3-ketosteroid 5beta-reductases) of the superfamily. Comparison
	of the proposed substrate binding pocket suggests residues 54 and
	118, near the active site, as possible discriminators between sugar
	and steroid substrates. In addition, sequence alignment and subsequent
	homology modelling of mouse liver 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
	and rat ovary 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase indicate that
	three loops on the C-terminal side of the barrel play potential roles
	in determining the positional and stereo-specificity of the hydroxysteroid
	dehydrogenases. Finally, we propose that the aldo-keto reductase
	superfamily may represent an example of divergent evolution from
	an ancestral multifunctional oxidoreductase and an example of convergent
	evolution to the same active-site constellation as the short-chain
	dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily.},

	resulted in a burst of success in the generation of novel proteins
	with native-like properties. A critical component of this coupling
	between theory and experiment is a detailed analysis of the structures
	and stabilities of designed proteins to assess and improve the accuracy
	of design algorithms. RESULTS: Here we report the solution structure
	of a hydrophobic core variant of ubiquitin, referred to as 1D7, which
	was designed with the core-repacking algorithm ROC. As a measure
	of conformational specificity, we also present amide exchange protection
	factors and backbone and sidechain dynamics. The results indicate
	that 1D7 is similar to wild-type (WT) ubiquitin in backbone structure
	and degree of conformational specificity. We also observe a good
	correlation between experimentally determined sidechain structures
	and those predicted by ROC. However, evaluation of the core sidechain
	conformations indicates that, in general, 1D7 has more sidechains
	in less statistically favorable conformations than WT. CONCLUSIONS:
	Our results provide an explanation for the lower stability of 1D7
	compared to WT, and suggest modifications to design algorithms that
	may improve the accuracy with which structure and stability are predicted.
	The results also demonstrate that core packing can affect conformational
	flexibility in subtle ways that are likely to be important for the
	design of function and protein-ligand interactions.},

	projects involves the substitution of residues to alanine, based

  abstract = {In the template-based modeling (TBM) category of CASP10 experiment,
	we introduced a new protocol called PMS (Protein Modeling System)
	to generate accurate protein structures in terms of side-chains as
	well as backbone trace. In the new protocol, a global optimization
	algorithm, called conformational space annealing (CSA), is applied
	to the three layers of template-based modeling procedure: multiple
	sequence-structure alignment, 3D chain building, and side-chain re-modeling.
	For 3D chain building, we developed a new energy function which includes
	new distance restraint terms of Lorentzian type (derived from multiple
	templates), and new energy terms that combine (physical) energy terms
	such as dynamic fragment assembly (DFA) energy, DFIRE statistical
	potential energy, hydrogen bonding term, etc. These physical energy
	terms are expected to guide the structure modeling especially for
	loop regions where no template structures are available. In addition,
	we developed a new quality assessment method based on random forest

	of proteins experimentally investigated with regard to glycosylation
	status. From O-GLYCBASE a total of 86 mammalian proteins experimentally
	investigated for in vivo O-GalNAc sites were extracted. Mammalian
	protein homolog comparisons showed that a glycosylated serine or
	threonine is less likely to be precisely conserved than a nonglycosylated
	one. The Protein Data Bank was analyzed for structural information,
	and 12 glycosylated structures were obtained. All positive sites
	were found in coil or turn regions. A method for predicting the location
	for mucin-type glycosylation sites was trained using a neural network
	approach. The best overall network used as input amino acid composition,
	averaged surface accessibility predictions together with substitution
	matrix profile encoding of the sequence. To improve prediction on
	isolated (single) sites, networks were trained on isolated sites
	only. The final method combines predictions from the best overall
	network and the best isolated site network; this prediction method
	correctly predicted 76% of the glycosylated residues and 93% of the
	nonglycosylated residues. NetOGlyc 3.1 can predict sites for completely
	new proteins without losing its performance. The fact that the sites
	could be predicted from averaged properties together with the fact
	that glycosylation sites are not precisely conserved indicates that
	mucin-type glycosylation in most cases is a bulk property and not
	a very site-specific one. NetOGlyc 3.1 is made available at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netoglyc.}

	SWISS-PROT is a protein sequence database, which aims to be nonredundant,
	fully annotated and highly cross-referenced. Most eukaryotic gene
	products undergo co-and/or post-translational modifications, and
	these need to be included in the database in order to describe the
	mature protein. SWISS-PROT includes information on many types of
	different protein modifications. As glycosylation is the most common
	type of post-translational protein modification, we are currently
	placing an emphasis on annotation of protein glycosylation in SWISS-PROT.
	Information on the position of the sugar within the polypeptide chain,
	the reducing terminal linkage as well as additional information on
	biological function of the sugar is included in the database. In
	this paper we describe how we account for the different types of
	protein glycosylation, namely N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation,
	proteoglycans, C-linked glycosylation and the attachment of glycosyl-phosphatidylinosital

  abstract = {Enzymes play a key role in almost all biological processes, accelerating
	a variety of metabolic reactions as well as controlling energy transduction,
	the transcription, and translation of genetic information, and signaling.
	They possess the remarkable capacity to accelerate reactions by many
	orders of magnitude compared to their uncatalyzed counterparts, making
	feasible crucial processes that would otherwise not occur on biologically
	relevant timescales. Thus, there is broad interest in understanding
	the catalytic power of enzymes on a molecular level. Several proposals
	have been put forward to try to explain this phenomenon, and one
	that has rapidly gained momentum in recent years is the idea that
	enzyme dynamics somehow contributes to catalysis. This review examines
	the dynamical proposal in a critical way, considering basically all
	reasonable definitions, including (but not limited to) such proposed
	effects as "coupling between conformational and chemical motions,"
	"landscape searches" and "entropy funnels." It is shown that none
	of these proposed effects have been experimentally demonstrated to
	contribute to catalysis, nor are they supported by consistent theoretical
	studies. On the other hand, it is clarified that careful simulation
	studies have excluded most (if not all) dynamical proposals. This
	review places significant emphasis on clarifying the role of logical
	definitions of different catalytic proposals, and on the need for
	a clear formulation in terms of the assumed potential surface and
	reaction coordinate. Finally, it is pointed out that electrostatic
	preorganization actually accounts for the observed catalytic effects

	by genome research has increased the demand for computer software

	GPCRs are found in a wide range of organisms and are central to a
	cellular signalling network that regulates many basic physiological
	processes. They are the focus of a significant amount of current
	pharmaceutical research because they play a key role in many diseases.
	However, their tertiary structures remain largely unsolved. The methods
	described in this paper use only primary sequence information to
	make their predictions. We compare a simple nearest neighbor approach
	(BLAST), methods based on multiple alignments generated by a statistical
	profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and methods, including Support
	Vector Machines (SVMs), that transform protein sequences into fixed-length
	feature vectors. RESULTS: The last is the most computationally expensive
	method, but our experiments show that, for those interested in annotation-quality
	classification, the results are worth the effort. In two-fold cross-validation
	experiments testing recognition of GPCR subfamilies that bind a specific
	ligand (such as a histamine molecule), the errors per sequence at

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: A new hidden Markov model method (SAM-T98) for finding
	remote homologs of protein sequences is described and evaluated.
	The method begins with a single target sequence and iteratively builds
	a hidden Markov model (HMM) from the sequence and homologs found
	using the HMM for database search. SAM-T98 is also used to construct
	model libraries automatically from sequences in structural databases.
	METHODS: We evaluate the SAM-T98 method with four datasets. Three
	of the test sets are fold-recognition tests, where the correct answers
	are determined by structural similarity. The fourth uses a curated
	database. The method is compared against WU-BLASTP and against DOUBLE-BLAST,
	a two-step method similar to ISS, but using BLAST instead of FASTA.
	RESULTS: SAM-T98 had the fewest errors in all tests-dramatically
	so for the fold-recognition tests. At the minimum-error point on
	the SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins)-domains test, SAM-T98
	got 880 true positives and 68 false positives, DOUBLE-BLAST got 533
	true positives with 71 false positives, and WU-BLASTP got 353 true
	positives with 24 false positives. The method is optimized to recognize
	superfamilies, and would require parameter adjustment to be used
	to find family or fold relationships. One key to the performance
	of the HMM method is a new score-normalization technique that compares
	the score to the score with a reversed model rather than to a uniform
	null model. AVAILABILITY: A World Wide Web server, as well as information

	multiple aligner, CLUSTALW. RESULTS: The paper evaluates the multiple-alignment

	determined NADP(+)-bound forms of XR reveals that XR has the ability
	to change the conformation of two loops. To accommodate both the
	presence and absence of the 2'-phosphate, the enzyme is able to adopt
	different conformations for several different side chains on these
	loops, including Asn(276), which makes alternative hydrogen-bonding
	interactions with the adenosine ribose. Also critical is the presence
	of Glu(227) on a short rigid helix, which makes hydrogen bonds to
	both the 2'- and 3'-hydroxy groups of the adenosine ribose. In addition
	to changes in hydrogen-bonding of the adenosine, the ribose unmistakably
	adopts a 3'- endo conformation rather than the 2'- endo conformation
	seen in the NADP(+)-bound form. These results underscore the importance
	of tight adenosine binding for efficient use of either NADH or NADPH

  abstract = {Xylose reductase is a homodimeric oxidoreductase dependent on NADPH
	or NADH and belongs to the largely monomeric aldo-keto reductase
	superfamily of proteins. It catalyzes the first step in the assimilation
	of xylose, an aldose found to be a major constituent monosaccharide
	of renewable plant hemicellulosic material, into yeast metabolic
	pathways. It does this by reducing open chain xylose to xylitol,
	which is reoxidized to xylulose by xylitol dehydrogenase and metabolically
	integrated via the pentose phosphate pathway. No structure has yet
	been determined for a xylose reductase, a dimeric aldo-keto reductase
	or a family 2 aldo-keto reductase. The structures of the Candida
	tenuis xylose reductase apo- and holoenzyme, which crystallize in
	spacegroup C2 with different unit cells, have been determined to
	2.2 A resolution and an R-factor of 17.9 and 20.8%, respectively.
	Residues responsible for mediating the novel dimeric interface include
	Asp-178, Arg-181, Lys-202, Phe-206, Trp-313, and Pro-319. Alignments
	with other superfamily members indicate that these interactions are
	conserved in other dimeric xylose reductases but not throughout the
	remainder of the oligomeric aldo-keto reductases, predicting alternate
	modes of oligomerization for other families. An arrangement of side
	chains in a catalytic triad shows that Tyr-52 has a conserved function
	as a general acid. The loop that folds over the NAD(P)H cosubstrate
	is disordered in the apo form but becomes ordered upon cosubstrate
	binding. A slow conformational isomerization of this loop probably
	accounts for the observed rate-limiting step involving release of
	cosubstrate. Xylose binding (K(m) = 87 mM) is mediated by interactions
	with a binding pocket that is more polar than a typical aldo-keto
	reductase. Modeling of xylose into the active site of the holoenzyme
	using ordered waters as a guide for sugar hydroxyls suggests a convincing
	mode of substrate binding.},

	cycles (DMCs) coupled with kinetic and calorimetric analyses of cognate
	Im9 and non-cognate Im2 binding, as well as computational analysis

	Im9 association from non-cognate Im2 association. E9 DNase Phe86
	is the primary specificity hotspot residue in the centre of the interface,
	which is coordinated by conserved and variable hotspot residues of
	the cognate Im protein. Experimental DMC analysis reveals that only
	modest coupling energies to Im9 residues are observed, in agreement

	the largely hydrophobic nature of E9 DNase-Im9 specificity contacts.
	Computed values for the 12 E9 DNase alanine mutants showed reasonable

  number = {1},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli exhibits diauxic growth in
	sugar mixtures due to CRP-mediated catabolite repression and inducer
	exclusion related to phosphotransferase system enzyme activity. Replacement
	of the native crp gene with a catabolite repression mutant (referred
	to as crp*) enables co-utilization of glucose and other sugars in
	E. coli. While previous studies have examined the effects of expressing
	CRP* mutants on the expression of specific catabolic genes, little
	is known about the global transcriptional effects of CRP* expression.
	In this study, we compare the transcriptome of E. coli W3110 (expressing
	wild-type CRP) to that of mutant strain PC05 (expressing CRP*) in
	the presence and absence of glucose. RESULTS: The glucose effect
	is significantly suppressed in strain PC05 relative to strain W3110.
	The expression levels of glucose-sensitive genes are generally not
	altered by glucose to the same extent in strain PCO5 as compared
	to W3110. Only 23 of the 80 genes showing significant differential
	expression in the presence of glucose for strain PC05 are present
	among the 418 genes believed to be directly regulated by CRP. Genes
	involved in central carbon metabolism (including several TCA cycle
	genes) and amino acid biosynthesis, as well as genes encoding nutrient
	transport systems are among those whose transcript levels are most
	significantly affected by CRP* expression. We present a detailed
	transcription analysis and relate these results to phenotypic differences
	between strains expressing wild-type CRP and CRP*. Notably, CRP*
	expression in the presence of glucose results in an elevated intracellular
	NADPH concentration and reduced NADH concentration relative to wild-type
	CRP. Meanwhile, a more drastic decrease in the NADPH/NADP+ ratio
	is observed for the case of CRP* expression in strains engineered
	to reduce xylose to xylitol via a heterologously expressed, NADPH-dependent
	xylose reductase. Altered expression levels of transhydrogenase and
	TCA cycle genes, among others, are consistent with these observations.
	CONCLUSIONS: While the simplest model of CRP*-mediated gene expression
	assumes insensitivity to glucose (or cAMP), our results show that
	gene expression in the context of CRP* is very different from that
	of wild-type in the absence of glucose, and is influenced by the
	presence of glucose. Most of the transcription changes in response
	to CRP* expression are difficult to interpret in terms of possible
	systematic effects on metabolism. Elevated NADPH availability resulting
	from CRP* expression suggests potential biocatalytic applications
	of crp* strains that extend beyond relief of catabolite repression.}

	to develop a method to theoretically predict the correct three-dimensional
	structure of a protein given its linear amino acid sequence. The
	ability to surmount this challenge, which is known as the protein
	folding problem, has tremendous implications. We introduce a novel
	ab initio approach for the protein folding problem. The accurate
	prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein relies
	on both the mathematical model used to mimic the protein system and
	the technique used to identify the correct structure. The models
	employed are based solely on first principles, as opposed to the
	myriad of techniques relying on information from statistical databases.
	The framework integrates our recently proposed methods for the prediction
	of secondary structural features including helices and strands, as
	well as beta-sheet and disulfide bridge formation. The final stage
	of the approach, which culminates in the tertiary structure prediction
	of a protein, utilizes search techniques grounded on the foundations
	of deterministic global optimization, powerful methods which can
	potentially guarantee the correct identification of a protein's structure.

  abstract = {Global optimization approaches are proposed for addressing both the
	protein folding and peptide docking problems. In the protein folding
	problem, the ultimate goal involves predicting the native protein
	conformation. A common approach,based on the thermodynamic hypothesis,
	assumes that this conformation corresponds to the structure exhibiting
	the global minimum free energy. However, molecular modeling of these
	systems results in highly nonconvex energy hypersurfaces. In order
	to locate the global minimum energy structure on this surface, a
	powerful global optimization method, alpha BB, is applied. The approach
	is shown to be extremely effective in locating global minimum energy
	structures of solvated oligopeptides. A challenging problem related
	to protein folding is peptide docking. In addressing the peptide
	docking problem, the task is not only to predict a macromolecular-ligand
	structure but to also rank the binding; affinities of a set of potential
	ligands. Many methods have used qualitative descriptions of the macromolecular-ligand
	complexes in order to avoid the need to perform a global search on
	the nonconvex energy hypersurface. In this work, a novel decomposition
	based approach that incorporates quantitative, atomistic-level energy
	modeling and global optimization is proposed. This approach employs
	the alpha BB global optimization method and is applied to the prediction

	protein sequence design, which optimizes the complete sequence of
	a protein based on the knowledge of its backbone structure, its amino
	acid composition and a physical energy function including van der

	The specificity of the designed sequence for its template backbone
	is imposed by keeping the amino acid composition fixed. Here, we
	show that our procedure converges in sequence space, albeit not to
	the native sequence of the protein. We observe that while polar residues
	are well conserved in our designed sequences, non-polar amino acids
	at the surface of a protein are often replaced by polar residues.
	The designed sequences provide a multiple alignment of sequences
	that all adopt the same three-dimensional fold. This alignment is
	used to derive a profile matrix for chicken triose phosphate isomerase,

  abstract = {X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements
	provide us with atomically resolved structures of an ever-growing
	number of biomolecules. These static structural snapshots are important
	to our understanding of biomolecular function, but real biomolecules
	are dynamic entities that often exploit conformational changes and
	transient molecular interactions to perform their tasks. Nuclear
	magnetic resonance methods can follow such structural changes, but
	only on millisecond timescales under non-equilibrium conditions.
	Time-resolved X-ray crystallography has recently been used to monitor
	the photodissociation of CO from myoglobin on a subnanosecond timescale,
	yet remains challenging to apply more widely. In contrast, two-dimensional
	infrared spectroscopy, which maps vibrational coupling between molecular
	groups and hence their relative positions and orientations, is now
	routinely used to study equilibrium processes on picosecond timescales.
	Here we show that the extension of this method into the non-equilibrium
	regime allows us to observe in real time in a short peptide the weakening
	of an intramolecular hydrogen bond and concomitant opening of a beta-turn.
	We find that the rate of this process is two orders of magnitude
	faster than the 'folding speed limit' established for contact formation

  publisher = {John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},
  year = {2001},
  author = {Konermann, Lars},
  abstract = {The biologically active (native) state of most proteins is characterised
	by a tightly folded and highly ordered conformation. Denaturants
	are chemical or physical agents that can induce unfolding of the
	polypeptide chain. Examples include urea, heat, extremes of pH, as
	well as some detergents. Unfolded proteins adopt a largely disordered
	structure. Denaturants can interact directly with the protein, or
	they can alter the properties of the surrounding aqueous environment.
	Despite the routine use of denaturants in the biochemical laboratory,
	the mechanisms whereby these agents destabilise the native state
	remain poorly understood. Folded protein structures are only marginally
	stable. As a result, relatively subtle alterations in the physical
	and chemical properties of the solvent can cause major changes in
	position of the unfolding equilibrium. This review briefly discusses
	the most commonly used denaturants, their likely mechanisms of action,
	as well as some thermodynamic aspects.Key Concepts:Key Concepts:
	
	* The biologically active (native) state N of proteins represents
	a highly ordered and tightly folded structure. * N is in equilibrium
	with an extensively disordered (unfolded) state U. * Denaturing agents
	(e.g. urea, extremes of pH and temperature) shift the unfolding equilibrium
	from N to U. * The exact mechanism of action remains unclear for
	most denaturants. * The position of the unfolding equilibrium is
	governed by an interplay of enthalpic and entropic contributions
	that affect the free energy of unfolding according to Î”G0=Î”H0â€“TÎ”S0.
	* The sign and magnitude of Î”G0 represents the thermodynamic stability
	of N; N is stable when Î”G0>0. * Unfolding can be triggered by increasing
	the temperature T, because U has a higher entropy than N (Î”S0>0).
	* Protein stability measurements are commonly carried out by employing
	urea or guanidinium chloride-induced unfolding in conjunction with
	optical detection. * Some proteins adopt semiunfolded structures
	(intermediates) under mildly denaturing conditions. * Protein (un)folding
	can be studied under equilibrium conditions and in kinetic experiments.},

	2 member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily of proteins

	mechanism of how it affects catalytic activity is outstanding. We
	have replaced His-113 by alanine using site-directed mutagenesis,
	determined a 2.2 A structure of H113A mutant bound to NADP(+), and
	compared catalytic reaction profiles of NADH-dependent reduction
	of different aldehydes catalyzed by the wild type and the mutant.
	Deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m
	xylose) show that, relative to the wild type, the hydride transfer
	rate constant (k(7) approximately 0.16 s(-1)) has decreased about
	1000-fold in H113A whereas xylose binding was not strongly affected.
	No solvent isotope effect was seen on k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m xylose)

	the position of Asp-50. A steady-state kinetic analysis for H113A-catalyzed
	reduction of a homologous series of meta-substituted benzaldehyde

	realistic models: YASARA, which runs molecular dynamics simulations
	of models in explicit solvent, using a new partly knowledge-based
	all atom force field derived from Amber, whose parameters have been
	optimized to minimize the damage done to protein crystal structures.
	The LEE-SERVER, which makes extensive use of conformational space
	annealing to create alignments, to help Modeller build physically
	realistic models while satisfying input restraints from templates
	and CHARMM stereochemistry, and to remodel the side-chains. ROSETTA,
	whose high resolution refinement protocol combines a physically realistic
	all atom force field with Monte Carlo minimization to allow the large
	conformational space to be sampled quickly. And finally UNDERTAKER,
	which creates a pool of candidate models from various templates and
	then optimizes them with an adaptive genetic algorithm, using a primarily
	empirical cost function that does not include bond angle, bond length,
	or other physics-like terms.},

	simulated annealing refinement (with no manual intervention) starting
	from an earlier model for the protein from a stage in the refinement
	when conventional least-squares methods could not improve the structure.
	Simulated annealing reduces the R factor at 2.5 A from 39 to 31%,
	with uniform temperature factors and no solvent molecules and with
	similar stereochemistry; the comparable value for the manually refined
	structure is 27.9%. Errors in backbone and sidechain positions up

	significant deviations between the two, with rms backbone displacements

	0.31 A for crambin at 0.945 A. More than 15 independent X-ray restrained
	molecular dynamics runs have been carried out for ribonuclease, and
	the displacements between the resulting structures are highly reproducible
	for most atoms. These include residues with two or more conformations
	with significant dihedral angle differences and alternative hydrogen
	bonding, as well as groups of residues that undergo displacements
	that are suggestive of rigid-body librations. The crystallographic
	R-values obtained are approximately 13%, as compared to 15.3% for
	a comparable refinement with a single structure. Least-squares optimization
	without an intervening restrained molecular dynamics stage is sufficient
	to reproduce most of the observed displacements. Similar results
	are obtained for crambin, where the higher resolution of the X-ray

	resulting atomic positions and isotropic temperature factors are
	compared with the average structure and fluctuations calculated directly

	and that the errors increase with the magnitude of the atomic fluctuations.
	Of particular interest is the fact that the refinement generally
	underestimates the atomic motions. Moreover, while the actual fluctuations
	go up to a mean-square value of about 5 A2, the X-ray results never
	go above approximately 2 A2. This systematic deviation in the motional
	parameters appears to be due to the use of a single-site isotropic
	model for the atomic fluctuations. Many atoms have multiple peaks
	in their probability distribution functions. For some atoms, the
	multiple peaks are seen in difference electron density maps and it
	is possible to include these in the refinement as disordered residues.
	However, for most atoms the refinement fits only one peak and neglects
	the rest, leading to the observed errors in position and temperature
	factor. The use of strict stereochemical restraints is inconsistent
	with the average dynamical structure; nevertheless, refinement with
	tight restraints results in structures that are comparable to those
	obtained with loose restraints and better than those obtained with
	no restraints. The results support the use of tight stereochemical
	restraints, but indicate that restraints on the variation of temperature

	Eleven forms of C. boidinii FDH were characterized by steady-state

	protein conformations. To date most of the energy functions used
	for this purpose have been extracted from a statistical analysis
	of the protein structure database, without explicit reference to
	the physical interactions responsible for protein stability. The
	use of the statistical functions has been supported by the widespread
	belief that they are superior for such discrimination to physics-based
	energy functions. An effective energy function which combined the
	CHARMM vacuum potential with a Gaussian model for the solvation free
	energy is tested for its ability to discriminate the native structure
	of a protein from misfolded conformations; the results are compared
	with those obtained with the vacuum CHARMM potential. The test is
	performed on several sets of misfolded structures prepared by others,
	including sets of about 650 good decoys for six proteins, as well
	as on misfolded structures of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. The vacuum
	CHARMM potential is successful in most cases when energy minimized
	conformations are considered, but fails when applied to structures
	relaxed by molecular dynamics. With the effective energy function
	the native state is always more stable than grossly misfolded conformations
	both in energy minimized and molecular dynamics-relaxed structures.
	The present results suggest that molecular mechanics (physics-based)
	energy functions, complemented by a simple model for the solvation
	free energy, should be tested for use in the inverse folding problem,
	and supports their use in studies of the effective energy surface
	of proteins in solution. Moreover, the study suggests that the belief
	in the superiority of statistical functions for these purposes may
	be ill founded.},

	diseases and is associated with diverse pathologies including type
	II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro, amyloidogenesis
	is widely studied in conditions that do not simulate the crowded
	and viscous in vivo environment. A high volume fraction of most biological
	fluids is occupied by various macromolecules, a phenomenon known
	as macromolecular crowding. For some amyloid systems (e.g. α-synuclein)
	and under shaking condition, the excluded volume effect of macromolecular
	crowding favors aggregation, whereas increased viscosity reduces
	the kinetics of these reactions. Amyloidogenesis can also be catalyzed
	by hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces, represented by the air-water
	interface in vitro and diverse heterogeneous interfaces in vivo (e.g.
	membranes). In this study, we investigated the effects of two different
	crowding polymers (dextran and Ficoll) and two different experimental
	conditions (with and without shaking) on the fibrilization of amyloid-β
	peptide, a major player in AD pathogenesis. Specifically, we demonstrate
	that, during macromolecular crowding, viscosity dominates over the
	excluded volume effect only when the system is spatially non homogeneous
	(i.e. an air-water interface is present). We also show that the surfactant
	activity of the crowding agents can critically influence the outcome
	of macromolecular crowding and that the structure of the amyloid
	species formed may depend on the polymer used. This suggests that,
	in vivo, the outcome of amyloidogenesis may be affected by both macromolecular
	crowding and spatial heterogeneity (e.g. membrane turn-over). More
	generally, our work suggests that any factors causing changes in
	crowding may be susceptibility factors in AD.},

	A new optimization method is presented to search for the global minimum-energy
	conformations of polypeptides. The method combines essential aspects
	of the build-up procedure and the genetic algorithm, and it introduces
	the important concept of â€œconformational space annealing.â€? Instead
	of considering a single conformation, attention is focused on a population
	of conformations while new conformations are obtained by modifying
	a â€œseed conformation.â€? The annealing is carried out by introducing
	a distance cutoff, Dcut, which is defined in the conformational space;
	Dcut effectively divides the whole conformational space of local
	minima into subdivisions. The value of Dcut is set to a large number
	at the beginning of the algorithm to cover the whole conformational
	space, and annealing is achieved by slowly reducing it. Many distinct
	local minima designed to be distributed as far apart as possible
	in conformational space are investigated simultaneously. Therefore,
	the new method finds not only the global minimum-energy conformation
	but also many other distinct local minima as by-products. The method
	is tested on Met-enkephalin, a 24-dihedral angle problem. For all
	100 independent runs, the accepted global minimum-energy conformation
	was obtained after about 2600 minimizations on average. Â© 1997 John

  abstract = {The generalized Born (GB) model is a simple continuum dielectric model
	for the calculation of molecular electrostatic solvation energies.
	It is a pairwise approximation to the solution of the Poisson equation
	for continuum electrostatic solvation. Key to the GB method is the
	calculation of Born radii for every atom in the system. We introduce
	two new methods for determining Born radii. The first is a two-parameter
	grid-based method that uses nearly the same molecular volume that
	is used in conventional Poisson calculations. The second is a five-parameter
	analytical method that utilizes a molecular volume built from a superposition
	of atomic functions. The analytical method, distinct from the grid-based
	algorithm, is amenable to force-based calculations, e.g., energy
	minimization and molecular dynamics. Unlike other Born radii methods,
	both algorithms employ a new empirically determined correction term
	that includes energetic effects beyond the Coulomb field approximation.
	With this correction term, the grid-based algorithm generally yields
	Born radii with greater than 0.99 correlation versus converged numerically
	derived Poisson Born radii. The analytical method reproduces Born
	radii with approximately 0.95 correlation versus Poisson-derived
	Born radii. With respect to absolute solvation energies, the grid-based
	method achieves an overall 1.3% error versus converged Poisson solutions
	for a set of 3029 single-chain proteins obtained from the Brookhaven
	Protein Data Bank. On the other hand, the analytic method delivers
	modest 2-4 % errors versus the Poisson solutions for the same data
	set. Results concerning absolute solvation energies of RNA and relative
	solvation energies in two sets of protein conformations are also
	presented. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

	that had been modified by interlayer exchange with cations possessing
	16-carbon alkyl chains: hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) and cetylpyridinium
	(CP). Isothermal analysis of ZEN adsorption (at 37 C, pH 6.5) indicated
	that the clay exchanged with CP at a level of less than or equivalent
	to the cation exchange capacity (CEC) binds ZEN primarily by a partition
	process. In contrast, clay exchanged at the 1.5 CEC level gave an
	S-shaped curve with at least two plateaus, suggesting additional
	mechanisms of adsorption. A capacity (Qmax) and distribution coefficient
	(Kd) for the first site were estimated. At acid pH, the adsorption
	capacity for 1.5 CEC CP clay decreased and the isotherm shape predicted
	a simple partition process. Conversely, the shape remained curved
	at alkaline pH, suggesting an adsorption site. These data imply an
	adsorption mechanism at neutral pH that involves hydrophobic attraction
	of ZEN into the interlayer in addition to multisite binding of the
	anionic form to hydroxyl groups on the edge of the clay via ion-dipole

  abstract = {Abstract We analyze the contact distance distributions between nonbonded
	atoms in known protein structures. A complete set of van der Waals
	(VDW) radii for 24 protein atom types and for crystal-bound water
	is derived from the contact distance distributions of these atoms
	with a selected group of apolar atoms. In addition, a set of Coulombic
	radii for polar atoms is derived from their contacts with water.
	The contact distance distributions and the two sets of radii are
	derived in a systematic and self-consistent manner using an iterative
	procedure. The Coulombic radii for polar atoms are, on average, 0.18
	Ã… smaller than their VDW radii. The VDW radius of water is 1.7 Ã…,
	which is 0.3 Ã… larger than its Coulombic radius. We show that both
	the VDW and the Coulombic radii of polar atoms are needed in calculating
	the molecular and solvent-accessible surfaces of proteins. The VDW
	radii are needed to generate the apolar portions of the surface and
	the Coulombic radii for the polar portions. The fact that polar atoms
	have two apparent sizes implies that a hydrophobic cavity has to
	be larger than a polar cavity in order to accommodate the same number
	of water molecules. Most surface area calculations have used only
	one radius for each polar atom. As a result, unreal cavities, grooves,
	or pockets may be generated if the Coulombic radii of polar atoms
	are used. On the other hand, if the VDW radii of polar atoms are
	used, the details of the polar regions of the surface may be lost.
	The accuracy of the molecular and the solvent-accessible surfaces
	of proteins can be improved if the radii of polar atoms are allowed
	to change depending on the nature of their contacting neighbors.
	The surface of a protein at a proteinâ€“protein interface differs
	from that in solution in that it has to be generated using at least
	two kinds of probes, one representing a typical apolar atom and the
	other a typical polar atom. This observation has important implications
	for docking, which relies on surface complementarity at the interface.

  journal = {Microb Cell Fact},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {36},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The NAD(P)H-dependent Pichia stipitis xylose
	reductase (PsXR) is one of the key enzymes for xylose fermentation,
	and has been cloned into the commonly used ethanol-producing yeast
	Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In order to eliminate the redox imbalance
	resulting from the preference of this enzyme toward NADPH, efforts
	have been made to alter the coenzyme specificity of PsXR by site-directed
	mutagenesis, with limited success. Given the industrial importance
	of PsXR, it is of interest to investigate further ways to create
	mutants of PsXR that prefers NADH rather than NADPH, by the alternative
	directed evolution approach. RESULTS: Based on a homology model of
	PsXR, six residues were predicted to interact with the adenine ribose
	of NAD(P)H in PsXR and altered using a semi-rational mutagenesis
	approach (CASTing). Three rounds of saturation mutagenesis were carried
	to randomize these residues, and a microplate-based assay was applied
	in the screening. A best mutant 2-2C12, which carried four mutations
	K270S, N272P, S271G and R276F, was obtained. The mutant showed a
	preference toward NADH over NADPH by a factor of about 13-fold, or
	an improvement of about 42-fold, as measured by the ratio of the
	specificity constant kcat/Kmcoenzyme. Compared with the wild-type,
	the kcatNADH for the best mutant was only slightly lower, while the
	kcatNADPH decreased by a factor of about 10. Furthermore, the specific
	activity of 2-2C12 in the presence of NADH was 20.6 U.mg-1, which
	is highest among PsXR mutants reported. CONCLUSION: A seemingly simplistic
	and yet very effective mutagenesis approach, CASTing, was applied
	successfully to alter the NAD(P)H preference for Pichia stipitis
	xylose reductase, an important enzyme for xylose-fermenting yeast.
	The observed change in the NAD(P)H preference for this enzyme seems
	to have resulted from the altered active site that is more unfavorable
	for NADPH than NADH in terms of both Km and kcat. There are potentials
	for application of our PsXR in constructing a more balanced XR-XDH
	pathway in recombinant xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae strains.}

	in the aerobic central metabolism for succinate production. One is
	the glyoxylate cycle and the other is the oxidative branch of the
	TCA cycle. Inactivation of ptsG and overexpression of a mutant Sorghum
	pepc in these two production systems showed that the maximum theoretical
	succinate yield of 1.0 mol/mol glucose consumed could be achieved.
	Furthermore, the two-route production system with ptsG inactivation

	protein scaffolds used to design and select families of proteins

	To date, the highest affinity (10)Fn3 variants have been selected
	by mRNA display of libraries generated by randomizing all three complementarity-determining
	region -like loops of the (10)Fn3 scaffold. The sub-nanomolar affinities
	of such antibody mimics have been attributed to the extremely large
	size of the library accessible by mRNA display (10(12) unique sequences).
	Here we describe the selection and affinity maturation of (10)Fn3-based
	antibody mimics with dissociation constants as low as 350 pM selected
	from significantly smaller libraries (10(7)-10(9) different sequences),
	which were constructed by randomizing only 14 (10)Fn3 residues. The
	finding that two adjacent loops in human (10)Fn3 provide a large
	enough variable surface area to select high-affinity antibody mimics
	is significant because a smaller deviation from wild-type (10)Fn3
	sequence is associated with a higher stability of selected antibody
	mimics. Our results also demonstrate the utility of an affinity-maturation
	strategy that led to a 340-fold improvement in affinity by maximizing
	sampling of sequence space close to the original selected antibody
	mimic. A striking feature of the highest affinity antibody mimics
	selected against lysozyme is a pair of cysteines on adjacent loops,
	in positions 28 and 77, which are critical for the affinity of the
	(10)Fn3 variant for its target and are close enough to form a disulfide
	bond. The selection of this cysteine pair is structurally analogous
	to the natural evolution of disulfide bonds found in new antigen
	receptors of cartilaginous fish and in camelid heavy-chain variable
	domains. We propose that future library designs incorporating such
	an interloop disulfide will further facilitate the selection of high-affinity,

	conditions, resulting in gradual melting of native structure that
	permits resolving folding mechanisms step-by-step at atomic resolution.
	Experimental studies of one-state downhill folding have typically
	focused on the thermal denaturation of proteins that fold near the
	speed limit (ca. 10(6) s(-1)) at their unfolding temperature, thus
	being several orders of magnitude too fast for current single-molecule
	methods, such as single-molecule FRET. An important open question
	is whether one-state downhill folding kinetics can be slowed down
	to make them accessible to single-molecule approaches without turning
	the protein into a conventional activated folder. Here we address
	this question on the small helical protein BBL, a paradigm of one-state
	downhill thermal (un)folding. We decreased 200-fold the BBL folding-unfolding
	rate by combining chemical denaturation and low temperature, and
	carried out free-diffusion single-molecule FRET experiments with
	50-?s resolution and maximal photoprotection using a recently developed
	Trolox-cysteamine cocktail. These experiments revealed a single conformational
	ensemble at all denaturing conditions. The chemical unfolding of
	BBL was then manifested by the gradual change of this unique ensemble,
	which shifts from high to low FRET efficiency and becomes broader
	at increasing denaturant. Furthermore, using detailed quantitative
	analysis, we could rule out the possibility that the BBL single-molecule
	data are produced by partly overlapping folded and unfolded peaks.
	Thus, our results demonstrate the one-state downhill folding regime
	at the single-molecule level and highlight that this folding scenario
	is not necessarily associated with ultrafast kinetics.},

  abstract = {A proteomic study using 2-D gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF MS was
	performed to characterize the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana plants
	to simulated acid rain (SiAR) stress, which is a global environmental
	problem and has become a serious issue in China in recent years.
	The emphasis of the present study was to investigate the overall
	protein expression changes when exposed to SiAR. Out of over 1000
	protein spots reproducibly resolved, 50 of them changed their abundance
	by at least 2-fold. Analysis of protein expression patterns revealed
	that a set of proteins associated with energy production, metabolism,
	cell rescue, cell defense and protein folding, etc., could play important
	roles in mediating plant response to SiAR. In addition to this, some
	proteins involved in stress responses and jasmonic acid pathway are
	also involved in plant response to SiAR. More interestingly, the
	expression of several ubiquitination-related proteins changed dramatically
	after 32-h SiAR treatment, suggesting that they may act as a molecular
	marker for the injury phenotype caused by SiAR. Based on our results,
	we proposed a schematic model to explain the mechanisms associated
	with the systematic response of Arabidopsis plants to SiAR.},

  abstract = {A method for optimizing potential-energy functions of proteins is
	proposed. The method assumes a hierarchical structure of the energy
	landscape, which means that the energy decreases as the number of
	native-like elements in a structure increases, being lowest for structures
	from the native family and highest for structures with no native-like
	element. A level of the hierarchy is defined as a family of structures
	with the same number of native-like elements (or degree of native
	likeness). Optimization of a potential-energy function is aimed at
	achieving such a hierarchical structure of the energy landscape by
	forcing appropriate free-energy gaps between hierarchy levels to
	place their energies in ascending order. This procedure is different
	from methods developed thus far, in which the energy gap and/or the
	Z score between the native structure and all non-native structures
	are maximized, regardless of the degree of native likeness of the
	non-native structures. The advantage of this approach lies in reducing
	the number of structures with decreasing energy, which should ensure
	the searchability of the potential. The method was tested on two
	proteins, PDB ID codes 1FSD and 1IGD, with an off-lattice united-residue
	force field. For 1FSD, the search of the conformational space with
	the use of the conformational space annealing method and the newly
	optimized potential-energy function found the native structure very
	quickly, as opposed to the potential-energy functions obtained by
	former optimization methods. After even incomplete optimization,
	the force field obtained by using 1IGD located the native-like structures
	of two peptides, 1FSD and betanova (a designed three-stranded Î²-sheet
	peptide), as the lowest-energy conformations, whereas for the 46-residue
	N-terminal fragment of staphylococcal protein A, the native-like
	conformation was the second-lowest-energy conformation and had an
	energy 2 kcal/mol above that of the lowest-energy structure.},

	Changes to the composition of the reaction medium are known to perturb

	hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima. However, the effect of solvent

	transfer catalyzed by E. coli DHFR is difficult to explain within
	a model, in which long-range motions couple to the chemical step

	of protein folding mechanisms. However, it has been pointed out that
	use of all-atom force fields does not guarantee more accurate representations
	of proteins; in fact, sometimes it even leads to biased structural
	distributions. Indeed, several issues remain to be solved in force
	field developments, such as accurate treatment of implicit solvation
	for efficient conformational sampling and proper treatment of backbone
	interactions for secondary structure propensities. In this study,
	we first investigate the quality of several recently improved backbone
	interaction schemes in AMBER for folding simulations of a beta-hairpin
	peptide, and further study their influences on the peptide's folding
	mechanism. Due to the significant number of simulations needed for
	a thorough analysis of tested force fields, the implicit Poisson-Boltzmann
	solvent was used in all simulations. The chosen implicit solvent
	was found to be reasonable for studies of secondary structures based
	on a set of simulations of both alpha-helical and beta-hairpin peptides
	with the TIP3P explicit solvent as benchmark. Replica exchange molecular
	dynamics was also utilized for further efficient conformational sampling.
	Among the tested AMBER force fields, ff03 and a revised ff99 force
	field were found to produce structural and thermodynamic data in
	comparably good agreement with the experiment. However, detailed
	folding pathways, such as the order of backbone hydrogen bond zipping
	and the existence of intermediate states, are different between the
	two force fields, leading to force field-dependent folding mechanisms.},

	which permits stereospecific transfer of the 4-pro-R hydride from
	NAD(P)H to substrate, is achieved by hydrogen bonds formed between
	the C3-carboxamide of the nicotinamide ring and Ser 166, Asn 167,
	and Gln 190 and by pi-stacking between this ring and Tyr 216. These
	residues were mutated to yield S166A, N167A, Q190A, and Y216S. In
	these mutants, K(d)(NADP(H)) increased by 2-11-fold but without a
	significant change in K(d)(NAD(H)). Steady-state kinetic parameters
	showed that K(m)(NADP)()+ increased 13-151-fold, and this was accompanied

	increased 4-8-fold, but changes in k(cat)/K(m)(NAD)()+ were more

	exist for NADP(H) and NAD(H). Importantly, these modes were revealed
	by mutating residues in the nicotinamide pocket indicating that direct
	interactions with the 2'-phosphate in the adenine mononucleotide
	is not the sole determinant of cofactor preference. The single mutations
	were unable to invert or racemize the stereochemistry of hydride
	transfer even though the nicotinamide pocket can accommodate both
	anti- and syn-conformers once the necessary hydrogen bonds are eliminated.
	When 4-pro-R-[(3)H]NADH was used to monitor incorporation into [(14)C]-5alpha-dihydrotestosterone,
	a decrease in the (3)H:(14)C ratio was observed in the mutants relative
	to wild-type enzyme reflecting a pronounced primary kinetic isotope
	effect. This observation coupled with the change in the binding energy
	for NAD(P)(H) in the transition state suggests that these mutants
	have altered the reaction trajectory for hydride transfer.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The level of sequence conservation between related nucleic
	acids or proteins often varies considerably along the sequence. Both
	regions with high variability (mutational hot-spots) and regions
	of almost perfect sequence identity may occur in the same pair of
	molecules. The reliability of an alignment therefore strongly depends
	on the level of local sequence similarity. Especially in regions
	of high variability, many alignments of almost equal quality exist,
	and the optimal alignment is highly arbitrary.Results: We discuss
	two approaches which deal with the inherent ambiguity of the alignment
	problem based on the computation of the partition function over all
	canonical pairwise alignments. The ensemble of possible alignments
	can be described by the probabilities Pij of a match between position
	i in the first and position j in the second sequence. Alternatively,
	we introduce a probabilistic backtracking procedure that generates
	ensembles of suboptimal alignments with correct statistical weights.A
	comparison between structure based alignments and large samples of
	stochastic alignments shows that the ensemble contains correct alignments
	with significant probabilities even though the optimal alignment
	deviates significantly from the structural alignment. Ensembles of
	suboptimal alignments obtained by stochastic backtracking can be
	used as input to any bioinformatics method based on pairwise alignment
	in order to gain reliability information not available from a single
	optimal alignment.Availability: The software described in this contribution

  abstract = {Here, we summarize the assessment of protein structure refinement

	Averaging over all groups and all proteins, there was no net improvement
	over the original starting models. However, there are now some individual
	research groups who consistently do improve protein structures relative
	to a starting starting model. We compare various measures of quality
	assessment, including (i) standard backbone-based methods, (ii) new
	methods from the Richardson group, and (iii) ensemble-based methods
	for comparing experimental structures, such as NMR NOE violations
	and the suitability of the predicted models to serve as templates
	for molecular replacement. On the whole, there is a general correlation
	among various measures. However, there are interesting differences.
	Sometimes a structure that is in better agreement with the experimental
	data is judged to be slightly worse by GDT-TS. This suggests that
	for comparing protein structures that are already quite close to
	the native, it may be preferable to use ensemble-based experimentally
	derived measures of quality, in addition to single-structure-based

  abstract = {Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields
	represent a powerful tool to obtain structure-function relationships
	at an atomic level, and are central in current efforts to solve the
	protein folding problem. The results from studies applying these
	tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields
	used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is
	crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in
	simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone,
	quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM) calculations
	were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides,
	and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular
	dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments.
	QM potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at
	the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were
	determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these molecules.
	The LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides
	were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides. These
	improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte
	Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function
	to contain peptide backbone phi, psi dihedral crossterms or a phi,
	psi grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations
	of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used
	to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with QM and
	crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the
	phi, psi dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction
	were required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22
	force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of phi
	and psi in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly,
	empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction
	for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences.
	These adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for the
	two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement with experimental
	crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of
	the CHARMM force field in treating proteins. This extension of the
	potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment
	of biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general.},

	compstatin peptide with up to 264-fold higher activity; one of these
	analogs is now in clinical trials for the treatment of age-related
	macular degeneration (AMD). Here we used functional assays, surface
	plasmon resonance (SPR), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
	to assess the effect of modifications at three key residues (Trp-4,
	Asp-6, Ala-9) on the affinity and activity of compstatin and its
	analogs, and we correlated our findings to the recently reported
	co-crystal structure of compstatin and C3c. The KD values for the
	panel of tested analogs ranged from 10âˆ’6 to 10âˆ’8â€‰M. These differences
	in binding affinity could be attributed mainly to differences in
	dissociation rather than association rates, with a >4-fold range
	in kon values (2â€“10â€‰Ã—â€‰105â€‰Mâˆ’1â€‰sâˆ’1) and a koff variation
	of >35-fold (1â€“37â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’2â€‰sâˆ’1) being observed. The stability
	of the C3b-compstatin complex seemed to be highly dependent on hydrophobic
	effects at position 4, and even small changes at position 6 resulted
	in a loss of complex formation. Induction of a Î²-turn shift by an
	A9P modification resulted in a more favorable entropy but a loss
	of binding specificity and stability. The results obtained by the
	three methods utilized here were highly correlated with regard to
	the activity/affinity of the analogs. Thus, our analyses have identified
	essential structural features of compstatin and provided important
	information to support the development of analogs with improved efficacy.

  abstract = {We present new findings in our drug discovery effort to develop an
	anticomplement therapeutic. We have designed several active analogues
	of compstatin by altering its amino acid composition at positions
	4 and 9. The most effective analogues have tryptophan or fused-ring
	non-natural amino acids at position 4 and alanine or an unbranched
	single-methyl amino acid at position 9. Twenty-one of these analogues
	have 2-99-fold higher activities compared to the parent peptide compstatin.
	The analogue Ac-V4(2Nal)/H9A-NH(2) has the highest inhibitory activity
	with IC(50) 500 nM. NMR data, through NOE and chemical shift analysis,
	suggest the presence of interconverting conformers spanning the extended
	and helical regions of the Ramachandran plot, and they detect a predominant
	averaged conformer with coil structure and at least one flexible
	beta-turn, of type I. The fused-ring non-natural amino acids at position
	4 contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic cluster of compstatin,
	which has been previously proposed, together with the beta-turn and
	a disulfide bridge, to be essential for binding to the target of
	compstatin, complement component C3. We propose that additional mechanisms
	may contribute to the structural stability of the analogues and to
	binding to C3, involving intra- and intermolecular electrostatic
	interactions of the pi-electron system of side chain aromatic rings.
	The presence of pi-pi interactions for Trp4-Trp7 was confirmed with
	a molecular dynamics simulation for the most active analogue with
	natural amino acids, Ac-V4W/H9A-NH(2). Alanine or aminobutyric acid
	at position 9 contribute to the weak propensity for helical structure
	of the residue segment 4-10 of the analogues, which may also play
	a role in increased activity.},

	target glycoproteins are necessary to facilitate their isolation
	from total cell lysates prior to their identification by mass spectrometry-based

	must selectively target characteristics associated with proteins

	cells and a hydrazide resin to capture the labeled glycoproteins
	and another that targets glycoproteins with sialic acid residues
	using lectin affinity chromatography, in conjunction with liquid

	of methods dramatically increases coverage of the plasma membrane
	proteome (more than one-half of the membrane glycoproteins were identified
	by the two methods uniquely) and also results in the identification
	of a large number of secreted glycoproteins. Our approach avoids
	the need for subcellular fractionation and utilizes a simple detergent
	lysis step that effectively solubilizes membrane glycoproteins. The
	plasma membrane localization of a subset of proteins identified was
	validated, and the dynamics of their expression in HeLa cells was
	evaluated during the cell cycle. Results obtained from the cell cycle
	studies demonstrate that plasma membrane protein expression can change

  abstract = {The Wilson equation for the excess Gibbs energy has found wide use
	in successfully representing the behavior of polar and nonpolar multicomponent
	mixtures with only binary parameters but was incapable of predicting
	more than one liquid phase. The UNIFAC and ASOG group contribution
	methods do not have this limitation and can predict the presence
	of multiple liquid phases. The most important area of application
	of all these equations is in the prediction of phase equilibria.
	The calculation of phase equilibria involves two important problems:
	(i) the minimization of the Gibbs free energy and (ii) the tangent
	plane stability criterion. Problem ii, which can be implemented as
	the minimization of the tangent plane distance function, has found
	wide application in aiding the search for the global minimum of the
	Gibbs free energy. However, a drawback of all previous approaches
	is that they could not provide theoretical guarantees that the true
	equilibrium solution will be obtained. The goal of this work is to
	find the equilibrium solution corresponding to the global minimum
	of the Gibbs free energy. A proof that the Wilson equation leads
	to a convex formulation for the minimization of the Gibbs energy
	is provided so that a local optimization technique will always converge
	to a global minimum. In addition, new expressions are derived for
	the molar Gibbs free energy function when the UNIFAC, ASOG, and modified
	Wilson equations are employed. These expressions are then transformed
	so that application of a branch and bound based global optimization
	algorithm originally due to Falk and Soland (1969) is possible. This
	allows global solutions to be obtained for both the minimization
	of the Gibbs free energy and the minimization of the tangent plane
	distance function. The algorithm is implemented in C as part of the
	package GLOPEQ, global optimization for the phase equilibrium problem
	(McDonald and Floudas, 1994d). Results for several examples are presented.},

	In achieving this goal, there are two distinct problems of relevance:
	(i) the minimization of the Gibbs free energy, denoted (G), and (ii)
	the minimization of the tangent plane distance function, or the tangent
	plane stability criterion, denoted (S). For all these activity coefficient
	models, GLOPEQ (GLobal OPtimization for the Phase and chemical EQuilibrium
	problem) can guarantee global solutions for problems (G) and (S),
	but a combined algorithm employs them in tandem, using (G) to generate
	candidate equilibrium solutions which can then be verified for thermodynamic
	stability by solving (S). Two key features of the combined algorithm
	are that (i) as much information as is possible is obtained from
	local searches, and (ii) it is preferable to verify a globally stable
	equilibrium solution using the tangent plane criterion, as this problem
	contains fewer variables than the minimization of the Gibbs free
	energy. Results for several examples are presented, and all but one
	of them are for the case of phase equilibrium, due to the paucity
	of examples for reacting systems that employ excess Gibbs free energy
	models. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd},

	by screening of variants with increased thermostability. Of the 12

	Combining the most thermostabilizing mutation at each site resulted
	in a variant that showed a 100-fold increase in half-life at 62Â°C

	ferredoxin I are presented for native and mutant forms. The protein
	contains two iron-sulfur clusters, one of which ([3Fe-4S]) is believed
	to play a central role in the electron-coupled proton transfer. Different
	charge sets for the [3Fe-4S] cluster in its reduced and oxidized
	state are calculated with broken symmetry ab initio density functional
	theory methods and used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The
	validity of the ab initio calculations is assessed by comparing partially
	optimized structures of the [3Fe-4S] clusters with x-ray structures.
	Possible proton transfer pathways between the protein and the iron-sulfur
	cluster are examined by both MD simulations and ab initio calculations.
	The MD simulations identify three main-chain hydrogen atoms--HN(13),
	HN(14), and HN(16)--that are within H-bonding distance of the [3Fe-4S]
	cluster throughout the MD simulations. They could thus play a role
	in the proton transfer from the protein to the iron-sulfur cluster.
	By contrast, the HD2(15) atom of the Asp-15 is seldom close enough
	to the [3Fe-4S] cluster to transfer a proton. Poisson-Boltzmann calculations
	indicate that there is a low, but nonzero probability, that Asp-15
	is protonated at pH 7; this is a requirement for it to serve as a
	proton donor. Ab initio calculations with a fragment model for the
	protein find similar behavior for the transfer of a proton from the
	OH of the protonated side chain and the main-chain NH of Asp-15.
	The existence of a stable salt bridge between Asp-15 and Lys-84 in
	the D15E mutant, versus its absence in the wild-type, has been suggested
	as the cause of the difference in the rate of proton transfer. Extensive
	MD simulations were done to test this idea; the results do not support
	the proposal. The present findings, together with the available data,
	serve as the basis for an alternative proposal for the mechanism
	of the coupled electron-proton transfer reaction in ferredoxin I.},

	for NADP+. Furthermore, DeltaG121 DHFR requires conformational changes

	Asp122 in the betaF-betaG loop was independently substituted with
	asparagine, serine, and alanine-amino acids with decreasing abilities
	to hydrogen-bond. The kinetic analyses of the Asp122 mutants enabled
	the construction of kinetic schemes at pH 7.0 that demonstrate two
	striking features. First, a significant correlation exists between
	decreased binding of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate,
	reduced (NADPH), and decreased hydride transfer rates resulting from
	these mutations. In other words, the interactions of Asp122 are along
	the reaction coordinate leading to the transition state. Second,
	substitutions for Asp122 alter the catalytic pathway preferred by
	wild-type DHFR under saturating conditions of substrate and cofactor.
	Overall, the steady-state rate contains contributions from the product
	off rates from the DHFR.5,6, 7,8-tetrahydrofolate (H4F) and DHFR.NADPH.H4F
	complexes and from the rate of hydride transfer. These mutational
	effects support the mechanistic model whereby interloop contacts
	regulate an equilibrium of Met20 loop conformations that, in turn,
	modulate ligand affinity and turnover.},

  abstract = {As a continuation to our studies on the importance of interloop interactions
	in the Escherichia coli DHFR catalytic cycle, we have investigated
	the role of the betaG-betaH loop in modulating the closed and occluded
	conformations of the Met20 loop during the DHFR catalytic cycle.
	Specifically, to assess the importance of the hydrogen bond formed
	between Ser148 in the betaG-betaH loop and the Met20 loop, Ser148
	was independently substituted with aspartic acid, alanine, and lysine.
	Moreover, the betaG-betaH loop was deleted entirely to yield the
	Delta(146-148) DHFR mutant. Steady-state turnover rates for all mutants
	were at most 3-fold lower than the wild-type rate. Lack of an isotope
	effect on this rate indicated the chemistry step does not contribute
	to the steady-state turnover. Consistent with this finding, hydride
	transfer rates for the DHFR mutants were at least 10-fold greater
	than the observed steady-state rates. The values ranged from a 30%
	decrease (Ser148Ala and Ser148Lys) to a 50% increase (Ser148Asp)
	in rate relative to that of the wild type. Modifications of the betaG-betaH
	loop enhanced the affinity for the cofactor and decreased the affinity
	for pterin, as determined by the K(D) values of the mutant proteins.
	Further analysis of Ser148Ala and Delta(146-148) DHFRs indicated
	these effects were manifest mainly in ligand off rates, although
	in some cases the on rate was affected. The Ser148Asp and Delta(146-148)
	mutations perturbed the preferred catalytic cycle through the introduction
	of branching at key intermediates. Rather than following the single
	WT pathway which involves loss of NADP(+) and rebinding of NADPH
	to precede loss of the product H4F (negative cooperativity), the
	mutants can reenter the catalytic cycle through different pathways.
	These findings suggest that the role of the interloop interaction
	between the betaG-betaH loop and the Met20 loop is to modulate ligand
	off rates allowing for proper cycling through the preferred kinetic
	pathway.},

	changes involved, we have determined 4 high-resolution crystal structures,
	i.e., the structures of the wild-type enzyme (1.86 A resolution,
	R-factor of 16.8%), of the wild-type enzyme ligated with NADP (2.0

	close to the adenosine ribose, with a concomitant change of the ribose

	at the next meal with the use of a within-subject design. DESIGN:
	Thirty-seven volunteers (19 men, 18 women) aged 20-29 y consumed
	isocaloric cola beverages (215 kcal) sweetened with sucrose, HFCS
	42, or HFCS 55. HFCS 42 contains 42% fructose, and HFCS 55 contains
	55% fructose. Diet cola (2 kcal), 1%-fat milk (215 kcal), and no
	beverage were the control conditions. The 5 beverages were consumed
	at 1010 (2 h after a standard breakfast). Participants rated hunger,
	thirst, and satiety at baseline and at 20-min intervals after ingestion.
	A tray lunch (1708 kcal) was served at 1230, and energy intakes were
	measured. The free sugars content of sucrose-sweetened cola was assayed
	at the time of the study. RESULTS: We found no differences between
	sucrose- and HFCS-sweetened colas in perceived sweetness, hunger
	and satiety profiles, or energy intakes at lunch. The 4 caloric beverages
	tended to partially suppress energy intakes at lunch, whereas the
	no-beverage and diet beverage conditions did not; the effect was
	significant (P<0.05) only for 1%-fat milk. Energy intakes in the
	diet cola and the no-beverage conditions did not differ significantly.
	CONCLUSION: There was no evidence that commercial cola beverages
	sweetened with either sucrose or HFCS have significantly different
	effects on hunger, satiety, or short-term energy intakes.},

	substitutions ("Core-7") was identified as having the most favorable
	energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the
	presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein
	("Core-10") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins,
	as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site
	revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and
	subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic
	and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although
	neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein.
	The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several
	of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10
	differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers
	predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations
	similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts
	of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed
	structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within
	the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In
	the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree,
	re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however,
	water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites.
	This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules
	in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity
	of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein.
	While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost
	always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions
	may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience
	with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology

	onto the clay mineral montmorillonite has been studied in presence

	a lower tendency to be adsorbed on montmorillonite than the free
	GPS. GPS adsorption is higher at pH 4.2 than at pH 6.8, both in the

	remains almost permanently adsorbed onto soils and has very limited

  abstract = {The folding mechanism and dynamics of a helical protein may strongly
	depend on how quickly its constituent alpha-helices can fold independently.
	Thus, our understanding of the protein folding problem may be greatly
	enhanced by a systematic survey of the folding rates of individual
	alpha-helical segments derived from their parent proteins. As a first
	step, we have studied the relaxation kinetics of the central helix
	(L9:41-74) of the ribosomal protein L9 from the bacterium Bacillus
	stearothermophilus , in response to a temperature-jump ( T-jump)
	using infrared spectroscopy. L9:41-74 has been shown to exhibit unusually
	high helicity in aqueous solution due to a series of side chain-side
	chain interactions, most of which are electrostatic in nature, while
	still remaining monomeric over a wide concentration range. Thus,
	this peptide represents an excellent model system not only for examining
	how the folding rate of naturally occurring helices differs from
	that of the widely studied alanine-based peptides, but also for estimating
	the folding speed limit of (small) helical proteins. Our results
	show that the T-jump induced relaxation rate of L9:41-74 is significantly
	slower than that of alanine-based peptides. For example, at 11 degrees
	C its relaxation time constant is about 2 micros, roughly seven times
	slower than that of SPE(5), an alanine-rich peptide of similar chain
	length. In addition, our results show that the folding rate of a
	truncated version of L9:41-74 is even slower. Taken together, these
	results suggest that individual alpha-helical segments in proteins
	may fold on a time scale that is significantly slower than the folding
	time of alanine-based peptides. Furthermore, we argue that the relaxation
	rate of L9:41-74 measured between 8 and 45 degrees C provides a realistic
	estimate of the ultimate folding rate of (small) helical proteins
	over this temperature range.},

	paradox. Microsecond-folding proteins are supposed to fold near or
	at the folding speed limit (downhill folding), but yet their folding
	behavior seems to comply with classical two-state analyses, which
	imply the crossing of high free energy barriers. However, close inspection
	of chemical and thermal denaturation kinetic experiments in fast-folding
	proteins reveals systematic deviations from two-state behavior. Using
	a simple one-dimensional free energy surface approach we find that
	such deviations are indeed diagnostic of marginal folding barriers.
	Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of available fast-kinetic
	data indicates that many microsecond-folding proteins fold downhill
	in native conditions. All of these proteins are then promising candidates
	for an atom-by-atom analysis of protein folding using nuclear magnetic
	resonance.1 We also find that the diffusion coefficient for protein
	folding is strongly temperature dependent, corresponding to an activation
	energy of approximately 1 kJ.mol-1 per protein residue. As a consequence,
	the folding speed limit at room temperature is about an order of
	magnitude slower than the approximately 1 micros estimates from high-temperature
	T-jump experiments. Our analysis is quantitatively consistent with
	the available thermodynamic and kinetic data on slow two-state folding

	reductase that is active with both NADPH and NADH as coenzyme. This

	in yields of 76%. Aldose reductase consists of a single 43 kDa polypeptide
	with an isoelectric point of 4.70. Initial velocity, product inhibition
	and binding studies are consistent with a compulsory-ordered, ternary-complex
	mechanism with coenzyme binding first and leaving last. The catalytic
	efficiency (k-cat/K-m) in D-xylose reduction at pH 7 is more than
	60-fold higher than that in xylitol oxidation and reflects significant
	differences in the corresponding catalytic centre activities as well
	as apparent substrate-binding constants. The enzyme prefers NADP(H)
	approx. 2-fold to NAD(H), which is largely due to better apparent
	binding of the phosphorylated form of the coenzyme. NADP+ is a potent
	competitive inhibitor of the NADH-linked aldehyde reduction (K-i

	the presence of solution and applied electrochemical potential. Methanol
	proceeds via both direct and indirect pathways which are governed
	by the initial C-H and O-H bond activation, respectively. The primary
	path requires an ensemble size of between 3-4 Pt atoms, whereas the
	secondary path is much less structure sensitive, requiring only 1-2
	metal atoms. The CO that forms inhibits the surface at potentials
	below 0.66 V NHE. The addition of Ru results in bifunctional as well
	as electronic effects that lower the onset potential for CO oxidation.
	In comparison, formic acid proceeds via direct, indirect and formate
	pathways. The direct path, which involves the activation of the C-H
	bond followed by the rapid activation of the O-H bond, was calculated
	to be the predominant path especially at potentials greater than
	0.6 V. The activation of the O-H bond of formic acid has a very low
	barrier and readily proceeds to form surface formate intermediates
	as the first step of the indirect formate path. Adsorbed formate,
	however, was calculated to be very stable, and thus acts as a spectator
	species. At potentials below 0.6 V NHE, CO, which forms via the non-Faradaic
	hydrolytic splitting of the C-O bond over stepped or defect sites
	in the indirect path, can build up and poison the surface. The results
	indicate that the direct path only requires a single Pt atom whereas
	the indirect path requires a larger surface ensemble and stepped
	sites. This suggests that alloys will not have the same influence
	on formic acid oxidation as they do for methanol oxidation.},

  abstract = {Apoptosis is critical for organismal homeostasis and a wide variety
	of diseases. Caspases are the ultimate executors of the apoptotic
	programmed cell death pathway. As caspases play such a central role
	in apoptosis, there is significant demand for technologies to monitor
	caspase function. We recently developed a caspase activatable-GFP
	(CA-GFP) reporter. CA-GFP is unique due to its "dark" state, where
	chromophore maturation of the GFP is inhibited by the presence of
	a C-terminal peptide. Here we show that chromophore maturation is
	prevented because CA-GFP does not fold into the robust β-barrel of
	GFP until the peptide has been cleaved by active caspase. Both CA-GFP
	and GFP(1-10) , a split form of GFP lacking the 11th strand, have
	similar secondary structure, different from mature GFP. A similar
	susceptibility to proteolytic digestion indicates that this shared
	structure is not the robust, fully formed GFP β-barrel. We have developed
	a model that suggests that as CA-GFP is translated in vivo it follows
	the same folding path as wild-type GFP; however, the presence of
	the appended peptide does not allow CA-GFP to form the barrel of
	the fully matured GFP. CA-GFP is therefore held in a "pro-folding"
	intermediate state until the peptide is released, allowing it to
	continue folding into the mature barrel geometry. This new understanding
	of the structural basis of the dark state of the CA-GFP reporter
	will enable manipulation of this mechanism in the development of
	reporter systems for any number of cellular processes involving proteases

  abstract = {Microbial xylose reductase, a representative aldo-keto reductase of
	primary sugar metabolism, catalyzes the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction
	of D-xylose with a turnover number approximately 100 times that of
	human aldose reductase for the same reaction. To determine the mechanistic
	basis for that physiologically relevant difference and pinpoint features
	that are unique to the microbial enzyme among other aldo/keto reductases,
	we carried out stopped-flow studies with wild-type xylose reductase
	from the yeast Candida tenuis. Analysis of transient kinetic data
	for binding of NAD(+) and NADH, and reduction of D-xylose and oxidation
	of xylitol at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C provided estimates of rate
	constants for the following mechanism: E + NADH right arrow over
	left arrow E.NADH right arrow over left arrow E.NADH + D-xylose right
	arrow over left arrow E.NADH.D-xylose right arrow over left arrow
	E.NAD(+).xylitol right arrow over left arrow E.NAD(+) right arrow
	over left arrow E.NAD(+) right arrow over left arrow E + NAD(+).
	The net rate constant of dissociation of NAD(+) is approximately
	90% rate limiting for k(cat) of D-xylose reduction. It is controlled
	by the conformational change which precedes nucleotide release and
	whose rate constant of 40 s(-)(1) is 200 times that of completely
	rate-limiting E.NADP(+) --> E.NADP(+) step in aldehyde reduction
	catalyzed by human aldose reductase [Grimshaw, C. E., et al. (1995)
	Biochemistry 34, 14356-14365]. Hydride transfer from NADH occurs
	with a rate constant of approximately 170 s(-1). In reverse reaction,
	the E.NADH --> E.NADH step takes place with a rate constant of 15
	s(-1), and the rate constant of ternary-complex interconversion (3.8
	s(-1)) largely determines xylitol turnover (0.9 s(-1)). The bound-state
	equilibrium constant for C. tenuis xylose reductase is estimated
	to be approximately 45 (=170/3.8), thus greatly favoring aldehyde
	reduction. Formation of productive complexes, E.NAD(+) and E.NADH,
	leads to a 7- and 9-fold decrease of dissociation constants of initial
	binary complexes, respectively, demonstrating that 12-fold differential
	binding of NADH (K(i) = 16 microM) vs NAD(+) (K(i) = 195 microM)
	chiefly reflects difference in stabilities of E.NADH and E.NAD(+).
	Primary deuterium isotope effects on k(cat) and k(cat)/K(xylose)
	were, respectively, 1.55 +/- 0.09 and 2.09 +/- 0.31 in H(2)O, and
	1.26 +/- 0.06 and 1.58 +/- 0.17 in D(2)O. No deuterium solvent isotope
	effect on k(cat)/K(xylose) was observed. When deuteration of coenzyme
	selectively slowed the hydride transfer step, (D)()2(O)(k(cat)/K(xylose))
	was inverse (0.89 +/- 0.14). The isotope effect data suggest a chemical
	mechanism of carbonyl reduction by xylose reductase in which transfer
	of hydride ion is a partially rate-limiting step and precedes the
	proton-transfer step.},

	dehydrogenase complex (ODH), a key enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid
	cycle, was discovered in the actinomycete Corynebacterium glutamicum,
	a close relative of important human pathogens like Corynebacterium
	diphtheriae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Based on the finding
	that a C. glutamicum mutant lacking serine/threonine protein kinase
	G (PknG) was impaired in glutamine utilization, proteome comparisons
	led to the identification of OdhI as a putative substrate of PknG.
	OdhI is a 15-kDa protein with a forkhead-associated domain and a
	homolog of mycobacterial GarA. By using purified proteins, PknG was
	shown to phosphorylate OdhI at threonine 14. The glutamine utilization
	defect of the delta pknG mutant could be abolished by the additional
	deletion of odhI, whereas transformation of a delta odhI mutant with
	a plasmid encoding OdhI-T14A caused a defect in glutamine utilization.
	Affinity purification of OdhI-T14A led to the specific copurification
	of OdhA, the E1 subunit of ODH. Because ODH is essential for glutamine
	utilization, we assumed that unphosphorylated OdhI inhibits ODH activity.
	In fact, OdhI was shown to strongly inhibit ODH activity with a Ki
	value of 2.4 nM. The regulatory mechanism described offers a molecular
	clue for the reduced ODH activity that is essential for the industrial
	production of 1.5 million tons/year of glutamate with C. glutamicum.
	Moreover, because this signaling cascade is likely to operate also
	in mycobacteria, our results suggest that the attenuated pathogenicity
	of mycobacteria lacking PknG might be caused by a disturbed tricarboxylic

  abstract = {Proteins with homologous amino acid sequences have similar folds and
	it has been assumed that an unknown three-dimensional structure can
	be obtained from a known homologous structure by substituting new
	side-chains into the polypeptide chain backbone, followed by relatively
	small adjustment of the model. To examine this approach of structure
	prediction and, more generally, to isolate the characteristics of
	native proteins, we constructed two incorrectly folded protein models.
	Sea-worm hemerythrin and the variable domain of mouse immunoglobulin
	K-chain, two proteins with no sequence homology, were chosen for
	study; the former is composed of a bundle of four alpha-helices and
	the latter consists of two 4-stranded beta-sheets. Using an automatic
	computer procedure, hemerythrin side-chains were substituted into
	the immunoglobulin domain and vice versa. The structures were energy-minimized
	with the program CHARMM and the resulting structures compared with
	the correctly folded forms. It was found that the incorrect side-chains
	can be incorporated readily into both types of structures (alpha-helices,
	beta-sheets) with only small structural adjustments. After constrained
	energy-minimization, which led to an average atomic co-ordinate shift
	of no more than 0.7 to 0.9 A, the incorrectly folded models arrived
	at potential energy values comparable to those of the correct structures.
	Detailed analysis of the energy results shows that the incorrect
	structures have less stabilizing electrostatic, van der Waals' and
	hydrogen-bonding interactions. The difference is particularly pronounced
	when the electrostatic and van der Waals' energy terms are calculated
	by modified equations that include an approximate representation
	of solvent effects. The incorrectly folded structures also have a
	significantly larger solvent-accessible surface and a greater fraction
	of non-polar side-chain atoms exposed to solvent. Examination of
	their interior shows that the packing of side-chains at the secondary
	structure interfaces, although corresponding to sterically allowed
	conformations, deviates from the characteristics found in normal
	proteins. The analysis of incorrectly folded structures has made
	it clear that the absence of bad non-bonded contacts, though necessary,
	is not sufficient to demonstrate the validity of model-built structures
	and that modeling of homologous structures has to be accompanied
	by a thorough quantitative evaluation of the results. Further, certain
	features that characterize native proteins are made evident by their
	absence in misfolded models.},

	(Groves, J. T. J. Chem. Educ. 1985, 62, 928), with a key difference,namely
	that in the two-state rebound the reactivity and product distribution
	result from the interplay of two reactive states of the active ferryl-oxene
	(Por(+.)FeO) species of the enzyme: one state is low-spin (doublet)
	and the other high-spin (quartet). Transition-state structures, intermediates,
	and product complexes are identified for the two states. The bond

	transition structure. However, while in the high-spin state there
	forms a radical that has a significant barrier for rebound, in the
	low-spin state the rebound is virtually barrierless. Even though
	one cannot ignore incursion of a small amount of radicals in the
	low-spin state, it is clear that the radical has a significant lifetime
	mainly on the high-spin surface. The results are used to gain insight

	makes it possible to predict the dependence of the relative rates

	In the present study, eight double mutants at sites 67 and 121 (G67V/G121S,

	for three mutants, G67V/G121A, G67V/G121L, and G67V/G121S. The Gibbs
	free energy change of urea unfolding of double mutants could not
	be expressed by the sum of those of the respective single mutants

	G67V/G121C, and G67V/G121L is not equal to the sum of those for the

	does not hold for these double mutants, and that long-range interactions
	occur between sites 67 and 121, even though they are separated by
	27.7 A. This is evidence that the flexible loops play important roles

	GB1 hairpin analogs spanning a wide range of thermodynamic stabilities
	(DeltaG(U)(298)=-3.09 to+3.25 kJ/mol) were examined. Fold-stabilizing
	changes in the reversing loop can act either by accelerating folding

	of an attractive side-chain/side-chain Coulombic interaction at the
	chain termini further stabilizes this hairpin. The 1.9-fold increase
	in folding rate constant observed for this change at the chain termini
	implies that this Coulombic interaction contributes before or at
	the transition state. This observation is difficult to rationalize

  abstract = {Several studies have found millisecond protein folding reactions to
	be controlled by the viscosity of the solvent: Reducing the viscosity
	allows folding to accelerate. In the limit of very low solvent viscosity,
	however, one expects a different behavior. Internal interactions,
	occurring within the solvent-excluded interior of a compact molecule,
	should impose a solvent-independent upper limit to folding speed
	once the bulk diffusional motions become sufficiently rapid. Why
	has this not been observed? We have studied the effect of solvent
	viscosity on the folding of cytochrome c from a highly compact, late-stage
	intermediate configuration. Although the folding rate accelerates
	as the viscosity declines, it tends toward a finite limiting value
	approximately 10(5) s(-1) as the viscosity tends toward zero. This
	limiting rate is independent of the cosolutes used to adjust solvent
	friction. Therefore, interactions within the interior of a compact
	denatured polypeptide can limit the folding rate, but the limiting
	time scale is very fast. It is only observable when the solvent-controlled
	stages of folding are exceedingly rapid or else absent. Interestingly,
	we find a very strong temperature dependence in these "internal friction"-controlled
	dynamics, indicating a large energy scale for the interactions that
	govern reconfiguration within compact, near-native states of a protein.},

	In multicellular eukaryotes, the prevalence and evolutionary significance

	families dubbed SPACE INVADERS (or SPIN) whose consensus sequences
	are Ã¢â€°Ë†96% identical over their entire length (2.9 kb) in the

	clawed frog). In contrast, SPIN elements were undetectable in other
	species represented in the sequence databases, including 19 other
	mammals with draft whole-genome assemblies. This patchy distribution,
	coupled with the extreme level of SPIN identity in widely divergent
	tetrapods and the overall lack of selective constraint acting on
	these elements, is incompatible with vertical inheritance, but strongly
	indicative of multiple horizontal introductions. We show that these
	germline infiltrations likely occurred around the same evolutionary
	time (15Ã¢â‚¬â€œ46 mya) and spawned some of the largest bursts of
	DNA transposon activity ever recorded in any species lineage (nearly
	100,000 SPIN copies per haploid genome in tenrec). The process also
	led to the emergence of a new gene in the murine lineage derived
	from a SPIN transposase. In summary, HT of DNA transposons has contributed
	significantly to shaping and diversifying the genomes of multiple

  abstract = {We have designed a model lattice protein that has two stable folded
	states, the lower free energy native state and a latent state of
	somewhat higher energy. The two states have a sizable part of their
	structures in common (two "alpha-helices") and differ in the content
	of "alpha-helices" and "beta-strands" in the rest of their structures;
	i.e. for the native state, this part is alpha-helical, and for the
	latent state it is composed of beta-strands. Thus, the lattice protein
	free energy surface mimics that of amyloidogenic proteins that form
	well organized fibrils under appropriate conditions. A Go-like potential
	was used and the folding process was simulated with a Monte Carlo
	method. To gain insight into the equilibrium free energy surface
	and the folding kinetics, we have combined standard approaches (reduced
	free energy surfaces, contact maps, time-dependent populations of
	the characteristic states, and folding time distributions) with a
	new approach. The latter is based on a principal coordinate analysis
	of the entire set of contacts, which makes possible the introduction
	of unbiased reaction coordinates and the construction of a kinetic
	network for the folding process. The system is found to have four
	characteristic basins, namely a semicompact globule, an on-pathway
	intermediate (the bifurcation basin), and the native and latent states.
	The bifurcation basin is shallow and consists of the structure common
	to the native and latent states, with the rest disorganized. On the
	basis of the simulation results, a simple kinetic model describing
	the transitions between the characteristic states was developed,
	and the rate constants for the essential transitions were estimated.
	During the folding process the system dwells in the bifurcation basin
	for a relatively short time before it proceeds to the native or latent
	state. We suggest that such a bifurcation may occur generally for
	proteins in which native and latent states have a sizable part of
	their structures in common. Moreover, there is the possibility of
	introducing changes in the system (e.g., mutations), which guide
	the system toward the native or misfolded state.},

	PCR (EPPCR) or DNA shuffling (DS), demonstrated that those closer
	to the enzyme active site were more effective than distant ones at
	improving enzyme activity, substrate specificity or enantioselectivity.
	Since then, many studies have taken advantage of this observation
	by targeting site-directed saturation mutagenesis (SDSM) to residues
	closer to or within enzyme active sites. Here, we have analysed a
	set of SDSM studies, in parallel to a similar set from EPPCR/DS,
	to determine whether the greater range of amino-acid types accessible
	by SDSM affects the distances at which the most effective sites occur.
	We have also analysed the relative effectiveness for obtaining beneficial
	mutants of residues with different degrees of natural sequence variation,
	as determined by their sequence entropy which is related to sequence
	conservation. These analyses attempt to answer the question-how well
	focused have targeted mutagenesis strategies been? We also compared
	two different sets of active-site atoms from which to measure distances
	and found that the inclusion of catalytic, substrate and cofactor
	atoms refined the analysis compared to using a single key catalytic
	atom. Using this definition, we found that EPPCR/DS is not effective
	for altering substrate specificity at sites that are within 5 A of
	the active-site atoms. In contrast, SDSM is most effective when targeted
	to residues at <5-6 A from the catalytic, substrate or cofactor atom,
	and also for residues with intermediate sequence entropies. Furthermore,
	SDSM is capable of altering substrate specificity at highly and completely
	conserved residues in the active site. The results suggest ways in
	which directed evolution by SDSM could be improved for greater efficiency

  abstract = {The rapid increase in the number of experimentally determined protein
	structures in recent years enables us to obtain more reliable protein
	tertiary structure models than ever by template-based modeling. However,
	refinement of template-based models beyond the limit available from
	the best templates is still needed for understanding protein function
	in atomic detail. In this work, we develop a new method for protein
	terminus modeling that can be applied to refinement of models with
	unreliable terminus structures. The energy function for terminus
	modeling consists of both physics-based and knowledge-based potential
	terms with carefully optimized relative weights. Effective sampling
	of both the framework and terminus is performed using the conformational
	space annealing technique. This method has been tested on a set of
	termini derived from a nonredundant structure database and two sets
	of termini from the CASP8 targets. The performance of the terminus
	modeling method is significantly improved over our previous method
	that does not employ terminus refinement. It is also comparable or
	superior to the best server methods tested in CASP8. The success
	of the current approach suggests that similar strategy may be applied
	to other types of refinement problems such as loop modeling or secondary
	structure rearrangement.},

  abstract = {Contemporary template-based modeling techniques allow applications
	of modeling methods to vast biological problems. However, they tend
	to fail to provide accurate structures for less-conserved local regions
	in sequence even when the overall structure can be modeled reliably.
	We call these regions unreliable local regions (ULRs). Accurate modeling
	of ULRs is of enormous value because they are frequently involved
	in functional specificity. In this article, we introduce a new method
	for modeling ULRs in template-based models by employing a sophisticated
	loop modeling technique. Combined with our previous study on protein
	termini, the method is applicable to refinement of both loop and
	terminus ULRs. A large-scale test carried out in a blind fashion
	in CASP9 (the 9th Critical Assessment of techniques for protein structure
	prediction) shows that ULR structures are improved over initial template-based
	models by refinement in more than 70\% of the successfully detected
	ULRs. It is also notable that successful modeling of several long
	ULRs over 12 residues is achieved. Overall, the current results show

	to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. Of these the most extensively
	characterized is rat liver 3 alpha-HSD. The recently solved X-ray
	crystal structure shows that this enzyme adopts an (alpha/beta)8-barrel
	scaffold (Hoog et al. 1994). NAD(P)H binds in an extended anti-conformation
	and lies along the inner surface of the barrel. The nicotinamide
	ring is stabilized by interaction with Y216. The 4-pro(R)-hydrogen
	transferred in the reaction is in close proximity to Y55. K84, D50
	and H117 which are implicated in catalysis. These residues are located
	at the base of a hydrophobic pocket which is presumed to be involved
	in binding steroid hormone. This catalytic tetrad is conserved in
	members of the AKR superfamily. Mutant enzymes support roles for
	Y55 in steroid binding and for K84 as the general acid involved in
	catalysis. The gene for rat 3 alpha-HSD has been cloned and is 47
	kb in length and contains 9 exon-intron boundaries which are highly

  abstract = {Mammalian 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3 alpha-HSDs) inactivate
	circulating steroid hormones, and in target tissues regulate the
	occupancy of steroid hormone receptors. Molecular cloning indicates
	that 3 alpha-HSDs are members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily
	and display high sequence identity (> 60%). Of these, the most extensively
	characterized is rat liver 3 alpha-HSD. X-ray crystal structures
	of the apoenzyme and the E.NADP+ complex have been determined and
	serve as structural templates for other 3 alpha-HSDs. These structures
	reveal that rat liver 3 alpha-HSD adopts an (alpha/beta)8-barrel
	protein fold. NAD(P)(H) lies perpendicular to the barrel axis in
	an extended conformation, with the nicotinamide ring at the core
	of the barrel, and the adenine ring at the periphery of the structure.
	The nicotinamide ring is stabilized by interaction with Y216, S166,
	D167, and Q190, so that the A-face points into the vacant active
	site. The 4-pro-(R) hydrogen transferred in the oxidoreduction of
	steroids is in close proximity to a catalytic tetrad that consists
	of D50, Y55, K84, and H117. A water molecule is within hydrogen bond
	distance of H117 and Y55, and its position may mimic the position
	of the carbonyl of a 3-ketosteroid substrate. The catalytic tetrad
	is conserved in members of the AKR superfamily and resides at the
	base of an apolar cleft implicated in binding steroid hormone. The
	apolar cleft consists of a side of apolar residues (L54, W86, F128,
	and F129), and opposing this side is a flexible loop that contains
	W227. These constraints suggest that the alpha-face of the steroid
	would orient itself along that side of the cleft containing W86.
	Site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic tetrad indicates that
	Y55 and K84 are essential for catalysis. Y55S and Y55F mutants are
	catalytically inactive, but still form binary (E.NADPH) and ternary
	(E.NADH.Testosterone) complexes; by contrast K84R and K84M mutants
	are catalytically inactive, but do not bind steroid hormone. The
	reliance on a Tyr/Lys pair is reminiscent of catalytic mechanisms
	proposed for other AKR members as well as for HSDs that belong to
	the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, in which Tyr
	is the general acid, with its pKa being lowered by Lys. Superimposition
	of the nicotinamide rings in the structures of 3 alpha-HSD (an AKR)
	and 3 alpha, 20 beta-HSD (an SDR) show that the Tyr/Lys pairs are
	positionally conserved, suggesting convergent evolution across protein
	families to a common mechanism for HSD catalysis. W86Y and W227Y
	mutants bind testosterone to the E.NADH complex, with effective increases
	in Kd of 8- and 20-fold. These data provide the first evidence that
	the side of the apolar cleft containing W86 and the opposing flexible
	loop containing W227 are parts of the steroid-binding site. Detailed
	mutagenesis studies of the apolar cleft and elucidation of a ternary
	complex structure will ultimately provide details of the determinants
	that govern steroid hormone recognition. These determinants could
	provide a rational basis for structure-based inhibitor design.},

  abstract = {Non-rotameric ("off-rotamer") conformations are commonly observed
	for the side-chains of protein crystal structures. This study examines
	whether such conformations are real or artifactual by comparing the
	energetics of on and off-rotamer side-chain conformations calculated
	with the CHARMM energy function. Energy-based predictions of side-chain
	orientation are carried out by rigid-geometry mapping in the presence
	of the fixed protein environment for 1709 non-polar side-chains in
	24 proteins for which high-resolution (2.0 A or better) structures
	are available. For on-rotamer conformations, 97.6 % are correctly
	predicted; i.e. they correspond to the absolute minima of their local
	side-chain energy maps (generally to within 10 degrees or less).
	By contrast, for the observed off-rotamer side-chain conformations,
	63.8 % are predicted correctly. This difference is statistically
	significant (P<0.001) and suggests that while most of the observed
	off-rotamer conformations are real, many of the erroneously predicted
	ones are likely to be artifacts of the X-ray refinements. Probabilities
	for off-rotamer conformations of the non-polar side-chains are calculated
	to be 5.0-6.1 % by adaptive umbrella-sampled molecular dynamics trajectories
	of individual amino acid residues in vacuum and in the presence of
	an average protein or aqueous dielectric environment. These results
	correspond closely to the 5.7 % off-rotamer fraction predicted by
	the rigid-geometry mapping studies. Since these values are about
	one-half of the 10.2 % off-rotamer fraction observed in the X-ray
	structures, they support the conclusion that many of the latter are
	artifacts. In both the rigid-geometry mapping and the molecular dynamics
	studies, the discrepancies between the predicted and observed fractions
	of off-rotamer conformations are largest for leucine residues (approximately
	6 % versus 16.6 %). The simulations for the isolated amino acid residues
	indicate that the real off-rotamer frequency of 5-6 % is consistent
	with the internal side-chain and local side-chain-backbone energetics
	and does not originate from shifts due to the protein. The present
	results suggest that energy-based rotation maps can be used to find
	side-chain positional artifacts that appear in crystal structures

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Homology modeling is an important technique for making
	use of the rapidly increasing number of protein sequences in the
	absence of structural information. The major problems in such modeling,
	once the alignment has been made, concern the positions of loops
	and the orientations of sidechains. Although progress has been made
	in recent years for sidechain prediction, current methods appear
	to have a limit on the order of 70% in their accuracy. It is important
	to have an understanding of this limitation, which for energy-based
	methods could arise from inaccuracies of the potential function.
	RESULTS: A test of the CHARMM function for sidechain prediction was
	performed. To eliminate the multiple-residue search problem, the
	minimum energy positions of individual sidechains in ten proteins
	were calculated in the presence of all other sidechains in their
	crystal orientations. This test provides a necessary condition that
	any energy function useful for sidechain placement must satisfy.
	For chi1 x chi2 rotations, the accuracies were 77.4% and 89.5%, respectively,
	and in the presence of crystal waters were 86.5% and 94.9%, respectively.
	If there was an error, the crystal structure usually corresponded
	to an alternative local minimum on the calculated energy map. Prediction
	accuracy correlated with the size of the energy gap between primary
	and secondary minima. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the
	errors in current sidechain prediction schemes cannot be attributed
	to the potential energy function per se. The test used here establishes
	a necessary condition that any proposed energy-based sidechain prediction
	method, as well as many statistically based methods, must satisfy.},

	Molecular dynamics simulations of myoglobin and heme-imidazole subsequent
	to ligand dissociation were used to investigate the transient behavior
	of the Fe-proximal histidine coordinate and its possible involvement
	in geminate recombination. The calculations, in the context of the

	(substates) present at equilibrium or from nonequilibrium relaxation
	of the protein triggered by a perturbation such as ligand dissociation.
	The importance of these two processes is expected to depend on the
	time scale of rebinding relative to equilibrium fluctuations and
	nonequilibrium relaxation. Since NO rebinding occurs on the picosecond
	time scale of the calculated myoglobin relaxation, a time-dependent
	barrier is likely to be an important factor in the observed nonexponential
	kinetics. The general implications of the present results for ligand
	binding in heme proteins and its time and temperature dependence

	protein populations play an important role and that as the temperature

  abstract = {In this study, we modify and extend the bilevel optimization framework
	OptKnock for identifying gene knockout strategies in the Escherichia
	coli metabolic network, leading to the overproduction of representative
	amino acids and key precursors for all five families. These strategies
	span not only the central metabolic network genes but also the amino
	acid biosynthetic and degradation pathways. In addition to gene deletions,
	the transport rates of carbon dioxide, ammonia, and oxygen, as well
	as the secretion pathways for key metabolites, are introduced as
	optimization variables in the framework. Computational results demonstrate
	the importance of manipulating energy-producing/consuming pathways,
	controlling the uptake of nitrogen and oxygen, and blocking the secretion
	pathways of key competing metabolites. The identified pathway modifications
	include not only straightforward elimination of competing reactions
	but also a number of nonintuitive knockouts quite distant from the
	amino acid-producing pathways. Specifically, OptKnock suggests three
	reactions (i.e., pyruvate kinase, phosphotransacetylase, and ATPase)
	for deletion, in addition to the straightforward elimination of 2-ketoglutarate
	dehydrogenase, to generate a glutamate-overproducing mutant. Similarly,
	phosphofructokinase and ATPase are identified as promising knockout
	targets to complement the removal of pyruvate formate lyase and pyruvate
	dehydrogenase for enhancing the yield of alanine. Although OptKnock
	in its present form does not consider regulatory constraints, it
	does provide useful suggestions largely in agreement with existing

  abstract = {SUMMARY: Computational protein docking is a useful technique for gaining
	insights into protein interactions. We have developed an algorithm
	M-ZDOCK for predicting the structure of cyclically symmetric (Cn)
	multimers based on the structure of an unbound (or partially bound)
	monomer. Using a grid-based Fast Fourier Transform approach, a space
	of exclusively symmetric multimers is searched for the best structure.
	This leads to improvements both in accuracy and running time over
	the alternative, which is to run a binary docking program ZDOCK and
	filter the results for near-symmetry. The accuracy is improved because
	fewer false positives are considered in the search, thus hits are
	not as easily overlooked. By searching four instead of six degrees
	of freedom, the required amount of computation is reduced. This program
	has been tested on several known multimer complexes from the Protein
	DataBank, including four unbound multimers: three trimers and a pentamer.
	For all of these cases, M-ZDOCK was able to find at least one hit,
	whereas only two of the four testcases had hits when using ZDOCK
	and a symmetry filter. In addition, the running times are 30-40%
	faster for M-ZDOCK. AVAILABILITY: M-ZDOCK is freely available to

	coli reductase. We proposed to enhance the specificity of the E.
	coli reductase for folate by incorporating discrete elements of vertebrate
	secondary structure. Two vertebrate loop mutants, VLI and VLII containing
	3-7 additional amino acid insertions, were constructed and characterized
	by using steady-state kinetics, spectrofluorimetric determination
	of ligand equilibrium dissociation constants, and circular dichroism
	spectroscopy. Remarkably, the VLI and VLII mutants are kinetically
	similar to wild-type E. coli reductase when dihydrofolate is the
	substrate, although VLII exhibits prolonged kinetic hysteresis. Moreover,
	the VLI dihydrofolate reductase is the first mutant form of E. coli
	DHFR to display enhanced specificity for folate [(kcat/Km)mutant/(kcat/Km)wt
	= 13]. A glycine-alanine loop (GAL) mutant was also constructed to
	test the design principles for the VLI mutant. In this mutant of
	the VLI reductase, all of the residues from positions 50 to 60, except
	the strictly conserved amino acids Leu-57 and Arg-60, were converted
	to either glycine or alanine. A detailed kinetic comparison of the
	GAL and wild-type reductases revealed that the mutations weaken the
	binding by both cofactor and substrate by up to 20-fold, but under
	saturating conditions the enzyme exhibits a kcat value nearly identical
	to that of the wild type. The rate of hydride transfer is reduced
	by a factor of 30, with a compensating increase in the dissociation
	rate for tetrahydrofolate. Although key stabilizing interactions
	have been sacrificed (it shows no activity toward folate), the maintenance
	of the correct register between key residues preserves the activity
	of the enzyme toward its natural substrate. Collectively, neither
	specific proximal point site mutations nor larger, more distal secondary
	structural substitutions are sufficient to confer a specificity for
	folate reduction that matches that observed with the avian enzyme.

	software components written by others. In evolutionary bioinformatics,
	OSS comes in a broad range of programming languages, including C/C++,
	Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, and R. To avoid writing the same functionality
	multiple times for different languages, it is possible to share components
	by bridging computer languages and Bio* projects, such as BioPerl,
	Biopython, BioRuby, BioJava, and R/Bioconductor. In this chapter,
	we compare the two principal approaches for sharing software between
	different programming languages: either by remote procedure call
	(RPC) or by sharing a local call stack. RPC provides a language-independent
	protocol over a network interface; examples are RSOAP and Rserve.
	The local call stack provides a between-language mapping not over
	the network interface, but directly in computer memory; examples
	are R bindings, RPy, and languages sharing the Java Virtual Machine
	stack. This functionality provides strategies for sharing of software
	between Bio* projects, which can be exploited more often. Here, we
	present cross-language examples for sequence translation, and measure
	throughput of the different options. We compare calling into R through
	native R, RSOAP, Rserve, and RPy interfaces, with the performance
	of native BioPerl, Biopython, BioJava, and BioRuby implementations,
	and with call stack bindings to BioJava and the European Molecular
	Biology Open Software Suite. In general, call stack approaches outperform
	native Bio* implementations and these, in turn, outperform RPC-based
	approaches. To test and compare strategies, we provide a downloadable
	BioNode image with all examples, tools, and libraries included. The
	BioNode image can be run on VirtualBox-supported operating systems,

	generate multiple candidate models first, and then use a scoring
	function to select the best model among these candidates. In this
	work, we develop a scoring function using support vector regression
	(SVR). Both consensus-based features and features from individual
	structures are extracted from a training data set containing native
	protein structures and predicted structural models submitted to CASP5
	and CASP6. The SVR learns a scoring function that is a linear combination
	of these features. We test this scoring function on two data sets.
	First, when used to rank server models submitted to CASP7, the SVR
	score selects predictions that are comparable to the best performing
	server in CASP7, Zhang-Server, and significantly better than all
	the other servers. Even if the SVR score is not allowed to select
	Zhang-Server models, the SVR score still selects predictions that
	are significantly better than all the other servers. In addition,
	the SVR is able to select significantly better models and yield significantly
	better Pearson correlation coefficients than the two best Quality
	Assessment groups in CASP7, QA556 (LEE), and QA634 (Pcons). Second,
	this work aims to improve the ability of the Robetta server to select
	best models, and hence we evaluate the performance of the SVR score
	on ranking the Robetta server template-based models for the CASP7
	targets. The SVR selects significantly better models than the Robetta

	The influence of the distal Gly-121 residue on the chemical step

	been demonstrated previously [Cameron, C. E., and Benkovic, S. J.
	(1997) Biochemistry 36, 15792-15800]. In our continuing effort to
	identify catalytically important residues that are distal from the
	active site, we used sequence conservation information, kinetic data
	on site-directed mutants, dynamic motion information from NMR methods,
	and correlated motions from MD simulations to identify a subset of
	residues. Among them, the region spanning positions 41-45 is distal
	to the active site and was chosen as the focus for the mutagenesis
	and kinetic studies reported here. Specifically, the highly conserved
	Met-42 was selected for site-directed mutagenesis. While the reaction
	kinetics for the M42F mutant enzyme did not deviate from wild-type
	behavior, a 41-fold reduction in the forward hydride transfer rate
	was found for the M42W mutant. Given the established role of Gly-121
	in the hydride transfer process, double mutant enzymes involving
	positions 42 and 121 were constructed and characterized. These double
	mutant enzymes generally showed little changes in substrate and cofactor
	binding but synergistic decreases in forward hydride transfer rates,
	while the decreases in reverse rates were additive. Along with supporting

	distance-dependent force field that yields the native structure as
	the lowest energy structure and assigns higher energies to decoy
	structures that are quite similar as well as those that are less
	similar. The model also includes a set of physical constraints that
	were based on experimentally observed physical behavior of the amino
	acids. The force field was tested on two sets of test decoys not
	in the training set and was found to excel on all the metrics that
	are widely used to measure the effectiveness of a force field. The
	high resolution force field was successful in correctly identifying
	113 native structures out of 150 test cases and the average rank
	obtained for this test was 1.87. All the high resolution structures
	(training and testing) used for this work are available online and

	contacts in beta, alpha + beta, and alpha/beta proteins. The total
	energy of a protein is expressed as sum of a C(alpha)-C(alpha) distance
	dependent contact energy contribution and a hydrophobic contribution.
	The model selects contact that assign lowest energy to the protein

	enforce certain physically observed topological information. A new
	method based on hydrophobicity is proposed to find the beta-sheet
	alignments. These beta-sheet alignments are used as constraints for
	contacts between residues of beta-sheets. This model was tested on
	three independent protein test sets and CASP8 test proteins consisting
	of beta, alpha + beta, alpha/beta proteins and it was found to perform
	very well. The average accuracy of the predictions (separated by
	at least six residues) was approximately 61\%. The average true positive
	and false positive distances were also calculated for each of the
	test sets and they are 7.58 A and 15.88 A, respectively. Residue
	contact prediction can be directly used to facilitate the protein

	accurate force fields, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should

	models using MD have for the most part yielded disappointing results.
	It has thus far been unclear whether MD-based refinement is limited

	using all-atom simulations, each at least 100 Î¼s longâ€”more than
	100 times longer than previous refinement simulationsâ€”and a physics-based
	force field that was recently shown to successfully fold a structurally

	chosen from the refinement category of recent Critical Assessment
	of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments, we find that in most

  abstract = {Employing methods to assess the quality of modeled protein structures
	is now standard practice in bioinformatics. In a broad sense, the
	techniques can be divided into methods relying on consensus prediction
	on the one hand, and single-model methods on the other. Consensus
	methods frequently perform very well when there is a clear consensus,
	but this is not always the case. In particular, they frequently fail
	in selecting the best possible model in the hard cases (lacking consensus)
	or in the easy cases where models are very similar. In contrast,
	single-model methods do not suffer from these drawbacks and could
	potentially be applied on any protein of interest to assess quality
	or as a scoring function for sampling-based refinement.Here, we present
	a new single-model method, ProQ2, based on ideas from its predecessor,
	ProQ. ProQ2 is a model quality assessment algorithm that uses support
	vector machines to predict local as well as global quality of protein
	models. Improved performance is obtained by combining previously
	used features with updated structural and predicted features. The
	most important contribution can be attributed to the use of profile
	weighting of the residue specific features and the use features averaged
	over the whole model even though the prediction is still local.ProQ2
	is significantly better than its predecessors at detecting high quality
	models, improving the sum of Z-scores for the selected first-ranked
	models by 20\% and 32\% compared to the second-best single-model
	method in CASP8 and CASP9, respectively. The absolute quality assessment
	of the models at both local and global level is also improved. The
	Pearson's correlation between the correct and local predicted score
	is improved from 0.59 to 0.70 on CASP8 and from 0.62 to 0.68 on CASP9;
	for global score to the correct GDT_TS from 0.75 to 0.80 and from

  abstract = {Activation of the innate immune system plays a major role in nonalcoholic
	fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The complement system is an important
	component of innate immunity that recognizes danger signals such
	as tissue injury. We aimed to determine whether activation of the
	complement system occurs in NAFLD, to identify initiating pathways,
	and to assess the relation between complement activation, NAFLD severity,
	apoptosis, and inflammatory parameters. Liver biopsies of 43 obese
	subjects with various degrees of NAFLD and of 10 healthy controls
	were analyzed for deposition of complement factors C1q, mannose-binding
	lectin (MBL), C4d, activated C3, and membrane attack complex (MAC)-associated
	C9. Furthermore, hepatic neutrophil infiltration, apoptosis, and
	pro-inflammatory cytokine expression were quantified. Whereas complement
	activation was undetectable in the liver of healthy subjects, 74\%
	of the NAFLD patients showed hepatic deposition of activated C3 and
	C4d. C1q as well as MBL accumulation was found in most activated
	C3-positive patients. Strikingly, 50\% of activated C3-positive patients
	also displayed MAC-associated C9 deposition. Deposition of complement
	factors was predominantly seen around hepatocytes with macrovesicular
	steatosis. Subjects showing accumulation of activated C3 displayed
	increased numbers of apoptotic cells. Importantly, hepatic neutrophil
	infiltration as well as interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6 expression was
	significantly higher in patients showing activated C3 deposition,
	whereas patients with C9 deposition additionally had increased IL-1beta
	expression. Moreover, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was more
	prevalent in patients showing hepatic C9 or activated C3 deposition.
	CONCLUSION: There is widespread activation of the complement system
	in NAFLD, which is associated with disease severity. This may have
	important implications for the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD
	given the function of complement factors in clearance of apoptotic
	cells, hepatic fibrosis, and liver regeneration.},

	a number of developments were made to establish combined quantum

	with representative problems. Specifically, free energy perturbation
	and boundary potential methods for treating long-range electrostatics
	were implemented to test the robustness of QM/MM results for protein
	systems. It was shown that consistent models with sufficient sampling
	were able to produce quantitatively satisfactory results, such as
	pK(a) for titritable groups in the interior of T4-lysozyme, while
	an inconsistent treatment of electrostatics or lack of sufficient
	sampling may produce incorrect results. Modifications were made to
	an approximate density functional theory (SCC-DFTB) to improve the
	description of proton affinity and hydrogen-bonding, which are crucial
	for the treatment of PT in polar systems. Test calculations on water
	autoionization showed clearly that both improvements are necessary
	for quantitatively reliable results. Finally, the newly established
	SCC-DFTB/MM-GSBP protocol was used to explore mechanistic issues
	in carbonic anhydrase (CA). Preliminary results suggest that PT in
	CA occurs mainly through short water wires containing two water molecules
	in a thermally activated fashion. Although longer water wires occur
	with similar frequencies, PT along those pathways, on average, has
	substantially higher barriers, a result not expected based on previous
	studies. The fluctuations of water molecules peripheral to the water
	wire were found to make a larger impact on the PT energetics compared
	to polar protein residues in the active site, which are largely pre-organized
	and therefore have less tendency to reorganize during the reaction.},

	The server can be used to refine either a single protein structure
	or an ensemble of proteins starting from their unrefined coordinates
	in PDB format. The refinement method is particularly fast and accurate
	due to the underlying knowledge-based potential derived from structures
	deposited in the PDB; as such, the energy function implicitly includes
	the effects of solvent and the crystal environment. Our server allows
	for an optional but recommended step that optimizes stereochemistry
	using the MESHI software. The KoBaMIN server also allows comparison
	of the refined structures with a provided reference structure to
	assess the changes brought about by the refinement protocol. The
	performance of KoBaMIN has been benchmarked widely on a large set
	of decoys, all models generated at the seventh worldwide experiments
	on critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction
	(CASP7) and it was also shown to produce top-ranking predictions
	in the refinement category at both CASP8 and CASP9, yielding consistently
	good results across a broad range of model quality values. The web
	server is fully functional and freely available at http://csb.stanford.edu/kobamin.},

	local and long-range orientational information and can be easily
	measured and assigned once the backbone resonances of a protein have

	such methods will generalize to larger proteins with less complete
	data sets. Here we incorporate experimental RDC restraints into Rosetta,
	an ab initio structure prediction method, and demonstrate that the
	combined algorithm provides a general method for de novo determination
	of a variety of protein folds from RDC data. Backbone structures
	for multiple proteins up to approximately 125 residues in length
	and spanning a range of topological complexities are rapidly and
	reproducibly generated using data sets that are insufficient in isolation
	to uniquely determine the protein fold de novo, although ambiguities

  journal = {Proteins},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {55},
  pages = {656-77},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {A major limitation of current comparative modeling methods is the
	accuracy with which regions that are structurally divergent from
	homologues of known structure can be modeled. Because structural
	differences between homologous proteins are responsible for variations
	in protein function and specificity, the ability to model these differences
	has important functional consequences. Although existing methods
	can provide reasonably accurate models of short loop regions, modeling
	longer structurally divergent regions is an unsolved problem. Here
	we describe a method based on the de novo structure prediction algorithm,
	Rosetta, for predicting conformations of structurally divergent regions
	in comparative models. Initial conformations for short segments are
	selected from the protein structure database, whereas longer segments
	are built up by using three- and nine-residue fragments drawn from
	the database and combined by using the Rosetta algorithm. A gap closure
	term in the potential in combination with modified Newton's method
	for gradient descent minimization is used to ensure continuity of
	the peptide backbone. Conformations of variable regions are refined
	in the context of a fixed template structure using Monte Carlo minimization
	together with rapid repacking of side-chains to iteratively optimize
	backbone torsion angles and side-chain rotamers. For short loops,
	mean accuracies of 0.69, 1.45, and 3.62 A are obtained for 4, 8,
	and 12 residue loops, respectively. In addition, the method can provide
	reasonable models of conformations of longer protein segments: predicted
	conformations of 3A root-mean-square deviation or better were obtained
	for 5 of 10 examples of segments ranging from 13 to 34 residues.
	In combination with a sequence alignment algorithm, this method generates
	complete, ungapped models of protein structures, including regions
	both similar to and divergent from a homologous structure. This combined
	method was used to make predictions for 28 protein domains in the
	Critical Assessment of Protein Structure 4 (CASP 4) and 59 domains
	in CASP 5, where the method ranked highly among comparative modeling
	and fold recognition methods. Model accuracy in these blind predictions
	is dominated by alignment quality, but in the context of accurate
	alignments, long protein segments can be accurately modeled. Notably,
	the method correctly predicted the local structure of a 39-residue
	insertion into a TIM barrel in CASP 5 target T0186.},

  abstract = {Since the pioneering work of Plaxco, Simons, and Baker, it is now
	well known that the rates of protein folding strongly correlate with
	the average sequence separation (absolute contact order (ACO)) of
	native contacts. In spite of multitude of papers, our understanding
	to the basis of the relation between folding speed and ACO is still
	lacking. We model the transition state as a Gaussian polymer chain
	decorated with weak springs between native contacts while the unfolded
	state is modeled as a Gaussian chain only. Using these hamiltonians,
	our perturbative calculation explicitly shows folding speed and ACO
	are linearly related when only the first order term in the series
	is considered. However, to the second order, we notice the existence
	of two new topological metrics, termed COC(1) and COC(2) (COC stands
	for contact order correction). These additional correction terms
	are needed to properly account for the entropy loss due to overlapping
	(nested or linked) loops that are not well described by simple addition
	of entropies in ACO. COC(1) and COC(2) are related to fluctuations
	and correlations among different sequence separations. The new metric
	combining ACO, COC(1), and COC(2) improves folding speed dependence
	on native topology when applied to three different databases: (i)
	two-state proteins with only ??? and ? proteins, (ii) two-state proteins
	(???, ? and purely helical proteins all combined), and (iii) master
	set (multi-state and two-state) folding proteins. Furthermore, the
	first principle calculation provides us direct physical insights
	to the meaning of the fit parameters. The coefficient of ACO, for
	example, is related to the average strength of the contacts, while
	the constant term is related to the protein folding speed limit.
	With the new scaling law, our estimate of the folding speed limit
	is in close agreement with the widely accepted value of 1 ?s observed
	in proteins and RNA. Analyzing an exhaustive set (7367) of monomeric
	proteins from protein data bank, we find our new topology based metric
	(combining ACO, COC(1), and COC(2)) scales as N(0.54), N being the
	number of amino acids in a protein. This is in remarkable agreement
	with a previous argument based on random systems that predict protein
	folding speed depends on exp?(- N(0.5)). The first principle calculation
	presented here provides deeper insights to the role of topology in
	protein folding and unifies many parallel arguments, seemingly disconnected,
	demonstrating the existence of universal mechanism in protein folding
	kinetics that can be understood from simple polymer physics based
	principles.},

	was biphasic and did not follow a simple 1:1 interaction, suggesting

	activity. Analysis of Ala substitution analogs of Compstatin for

  abstract = {The number of all possible conformations of a polypeptide chain is

	do fold into unique native states in seconds (the Levinthal paradox).
	To determine how the Levinthal paradox is resolved, we use a lattice
	Monte Carlo model in which the global minimum (native state) is known.
	The necessary and sufficient condition for folding in this model
	is that the native state be a pronounced global minimum on the potential
	surface. This guarantees thermodynamic stability of the native state
	at a temperature where the chain does not get trapped in local minima.
	Folding starts by a rapid collapse from a random-coil state to a
	random semi-compact globule. It then proceeds by a slow, rate-determining
	search through the semi-compact states to find a transition state
	from which the chain folds rapidly to the native state. The elements
	of the folding mechanism that lead to the resolution of the Levinthal
	paradox are the reduced number of conformations that need to be searched
	in the semi-compact globule (approximately 10(10) versus approximately
	10(16) for the random coil) and the existence of many (approximately
	10(3)) transition states. The results have evolutionary implications

  abstract = {A three-dimensional lattice model of a protein is used to investigate
	the properties required for its folding to the native state. The
	polypeptide chain is represented as a 27 bead heteropolymer whose
	lowest energy (native) state can be determined by an exhaustive enumeration
	of all fully compact conformations. A total of 200 sequences with
	random interactions are generated and subjected to Monte Carlo simulations
	to determine which chains find the ground state in a short time;
	i.e. which sequences overcome the folding problem referred to as
	the Levinthal paradox. Comparison of the folding and non-folding
	sequences is used to identify the features that are required for
	fast folding to the global energy minimum. It is shown that successful
	folding does not require certain attributes that have been previously
	proposed as necessary for folding; these include a high number of
	short versus long-range contacts in the native state, a high content
	of the secondary structure in the native state, a strong correlation
	between the native contact map and the interaction parameters, and
	the existence of a high number of low energy states with near-native
	conformation. Instead, the essential difference between the folding
	and the non-folding sequences is the nature of the energy spectrum.
	The necessary and sufficient condition for a sequence to fold rapidly
	in the present model is that the native state is a pronounced energy
	minimum. As a consequence, the thermodynamic stability of the native
	state of a folding sequence has a sigmoidal dependence on temperature.
	This permits such a sequence to satisfy both the thermodynamic and
	the kinetic requirements for folding; i.e. the native state predominates
	thermodynamically at temperatures that are high enough for folding
	to be kinetically possible. The applicability of the present results

	in exchangeable cations and OM. The major FT-IR spectra changes occur
	when the samples are heated at 650 &deg;C because of the dehydroxylation
	of kaolinite and bentonite. The interaction between GPS and Londrina

	protein hybrid libraries that optimally balance library size with
	quality. The proposed procedure is directly applicable to oligonucleotide
	ligation-based protocols such as GeneReassembly, DHR, SISDC, and
	many more. Given a set of parental sequences and the size ranges
	of the parental sequence fragments, OPTCOMB determines the optimal
	junction points (i.e., crossover positions) and the fragment contributing
	parental sequences at each one of the junction points. By rationally
	selecting the junction points and the contributing parental sequences,
	the number of clashes (i.e., unfavorable interactions) in the library
	is systematically minimized with the aim of improving the overall
	library quality. Using OPTCOMB, hybrid libraries containing fragments
	from three different dihydrofolate reductase sequences (Escherichia
	coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Lactobacillus casei) are computationally
	designed. Notably, we find that there exists an optimal library size
	when both the number of clashes between the fragments composing the
	library and the average number of clashes per hybrid in the library
	are minimized. Results reveal that the best library designs typically
	involve complex tiling patterns of parental segments of unequal size

	of hybrid enzymes) libraries were prepared from the Escherichia coli
	and Bacillus subtilis dihydrofolate reductases, and the activities

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Currently, there exists tens of different microbial
	and eukaryotic metabolic reconstructions (e.g., Escherichia coli,
	Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis) with many more under
	development. All of these reconstructions are inherently incomplete
	with some functionalities missing due to the lack of experimental
	and/or homology information. A key challenge in the automated generation
	of genome-scale reconstructions is the elucidation of these gaps
	and the subsequent generation of hypotheses to bridge them. RESULTS:
	In this work, an optimization based procedure is proposed to identify
	and eliminate network gaps in these reconstructions. First we identify
	the metabolites in the metabolic network reconstruction which cannot
	be produced under any uptake conditions and subsequently we identify
	the reactions from a customized multi-organism database that restores
	the connectivity of these metabolites to the parent network using
	four mechanisms. This connectivity restoration is hypothesized to
	take place through four mechanisms: a) reversing the directionality
	of one or more reactions in the existing model, b) adding reaction
	from another organism to provide functionality absent in the existing
	model, c) adding external transport mechanisms to allow for importation
	of metabolites in the existing model and d) restore flow by adding
	intracellular transport reactions in multi compartment models. We
	demonstrate this procedure for the genome- scale reconstruction of
	Escherichia coli and also Saccharomyces cerevisiae wherein compartmentalization
	of intra-cellular reactions results in a more complex topology of
	the metabolic network. We determine that about 10% of metabolites
	in E. coli and 30% of metabolites in S. cerevisiae cannot carry any
	flux. Interestingly, the dominant flow restoration mechanism is directionality
	reversals of existing reactions in the respective models. CONCLUSION:
	We have proposed systematic methods to identify and fill gaps in
	genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. The identified gaps can be
	filled both by making modifications in the existing model and by
	adding missing reactions by reconciling multi-organism databases
	of reactions with existing genome-scale models. Computational results
	provide a list of hypotheses to be queried further and tested experimentally.}

	a constant part and a variable part that changes during hESC differentiation.
	hESC-associated N-glycans were downregulated and new structures emerged
	in the differentiated cells. Previously mouse embryonic stem cells
	have been associated with complex fucosylation by use of SSEA-1 antibody.
	In the present study we found that complex fucosylation was the most
	characteristic glycosylation feature also in undifferentiated hESC.
	The most abundant complex fucosylated structures were Lex and H type
	2 antennae in sialylated complex-type N-glycans.CONCLUSION:The N-glycan
	phenotype of hESC was shown to reflect their differentiation stage.
	During differentiation, hESC-associated N-glycan features were replaced
	by differentiated cell-associated structures. The results indicated
	that hESC differentiation stage can be determined by direct analysis
	of the N-glycan profile. These results provide the first overview
	of the N-glycan profile of hESC and form the basis for future strategies

	(ecDHFR) cycles through five detectable kinetic intermediates: holoenzyme,
	Michaelis complex, ternary product complex, tetrahydrofolate (THF)
	binary complex, and THF.NADPH complex. Isomorphous crystal structures
	analogous to these five intermediates and to the transition state
	(as represented by the methotrexate-NADPH complex) have been used
	to assemble a 2.1 A resolution movie depicting loop and subdomain
	movements during the catalytic cycle (see Supporting Information).
	The structures suggest that the M20 loop is predominantly closed
	over the reactants in the holoenzyme, Michaelis, and transition state
	complexes. But, during the remainder of the cycle, when nicotinamide
	is not bound, the loop occludes (protrudes into) the nicotinamide-ribose
	binding pocket. Upon changing from the closed to the occluded conformation,
	the central portion of the loop rearranges from beta-sheet to 3(10)
	helix. The change may occur by way of an irregularly structured open
	loop conformation, which could transiently admit a water molecule
	into position to protonate N5 of dihydrofolate. From the Michaelis
	to the transition state analogue complex, rotation between two halves
	of ecDHFR, the adenosine binding subdomain and loop subdomain, closes
	the (p-aminobenzoyl)glutamate (pABG) binding crevice by approximately
	0.5 A. Resulting enhancement of contacts with the pABG moiety may
	stabilize puckering at C6 of the pteridine ring in the transition
	state. The subdomain rotation is further adjusted by cofactor-induced
	movements (approximately 0.5 A) of helices B and C, producing a larger
	pABG cleft in the THF.NADPH analogue complex than in the THF analogue
	complex. Such movements may explain how THF release is assisted by
	NADPH binding. Subdomain rotation is not observed in vertebrate DHFR
	structures, but an analogous loop movement (residues 59-70) appears
	to similarly adjust the pABG cleft width, suggesting that these movements
	are important for catalysis. Loop movement, also unobserved in vertebrate
	DHFR structures, may preferentially weaken NADP+ vs NADPH binding
	in ecDHFR, an evolutionary adaptation to reduce product inhibition
	in the NADP+ rich environment of prokaryotes.},

	1.1.1.213, AKR1C9) is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily
	which inactivates circulating steroid hormones. We have proposed
	a catalytic mechanism in which Tyr 55 acts as a general acid with
	its pK value being lowered by a hydrogen bond with Lys 84 which is
	salt-linked to Asp 50. To test this mechanism, residues at the active
	site were mutated and the mutant enzymes (Y55F, Y55S, K84M, K84R,
	D50N, D50E, and H117A) were purified to homogeneity from an Escherichia
	coli expression system. Spectrophotometric assays showed that mutations
	of Tyr 55 and Lys 84 gave enzymes that were apparently inactive for
	steroid oxidation and reduction. All mutants appeared inactive for
	steroid reduction. The catalytic efficiencies for steroid oxidation
	were reduced 4-10-fold for the Asp 50 mutants and 300-fold for the
	H117A mutant. Fluorescence titration with NADPH demonstrated that
	each mutant bound cofactor unimpeded. Equilibrium dialysis indicated
	that the competitive inhibitor testosterone formed E.NADH.testosterone
	complexes only with the Y55F, Y55S, and D50N mutants with Kd values
	10-fold greater than those for wild-type. Therefore the loss of steroid
	oxidoreductase activity observed for the Tyr 55 mutants cannot be
	attributed simply to an inability to bind steroid. Using a highly
	sensitive radiometric assay in which the conversion of [14C]-5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone
	(DHT) to [14C]-3 alpha-androstanediol (3 alpha-Diol) was measured,
	the rate enhancement (kcat/knoncat) for the reaction was estimated
	to be 2.6 x 10(9). Using this assay, all mutants formed steroid product
	with decreases in an overall rate enhancement of 10(1)-10(4). It
	was found that Tyr 55 made the single largest contribution to rate
	enhancement. This is the first instance where point mutations in
	the conserved catalytic tetrad of an AKR yielded enzymes which were
	still catalytically active. This enabled the construction of pH vs
	kcat profiles for the reduction of [14C]-5 alpha-DHT catalyzed by
	the tetrad mutants. These profiles revealed that the titratable group
	assigned to the general acid (pK = 6.50 +/- 0.42) was eliminated
	in the Y55F and H117A mutants. The pH-independent value of kcat was
	decreased in the H117A and Y55F mutants, by 2 and 4 log units, respectively.
	pH vs kcat(app) profiles for the oxidation of [3H]-3 alpha-Diol showed
	that the same titratable group (pK = 7.50 +/- 0.30) was eliminated
	in both the Y55F and K84M mutants but was retained in the H117A mutant.
	Since only the Y55F mutant eliminated the titratable group in both
	the reduction and oxidation directions it is assigned as the catalytic
	general acid/base. The differential effects of His 117 and Lys 84
	on the ionization of Tyr 55 are explained by a "push-pull" mechanism
	in which His 117 facilitates proton donation and Lys 84 facilitates

	reach concentrations of >300 g/L and occupy >30\% of the volume.
	The volume excluded by these macromolecules stabilizes globular proteins
	because the native state occupies less space than the denatured state.
	Theory predicts that crowding can increase the ratio of folded to
	unfolded protein by a factor of 100, amounting to 3 kcal/mol of stabilization
	at room temperature. We tested the idea that volume exclusion dominates
	the crowding effect in cells using a variant of protein L, a 7 kDa
	globular protein with seven lysine residues replaced by glutamic
	acids; 84\% of the variant molecules populate the denatured state
	in dilute buffer at room temperature, compared with 0.1\% for the
	wild-type protein. We then used in-cell NMR spectroscopy to show
	that the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli does not overcome even this
	modest (∼1 kcal/mol) free-energy deficit. The data are consistent
	with the idea that nonspecific interactions between cytoplasmic components
	can overcome the excluded-volume effect. Evidence for these interactions
	is provided by the observations that adding simple salts folds the
	variant in dilute solution but increasing the salt concentration
	inside E. coli does not fold the protein. Our data are consistent
	with the results of other studies of protein stability in cells and
	suggest that stabilizing excluded-volume effects, which must be present
	under crowded conditions, can be ameliorated by nonspecific interactions
	between cytoplasmic components.},

	the most conserved positions in multiple sequence alignments are
	significantly more clustered than randomly selected sets of positions.
	The comparison to random subsets is not necessarily appropriate,
	however, because the signal could be the result of differences in
	the amino acid composition of sets of conserved residues compared
	to random subsets (hydrophobic residues tend to be close together
	in the protein core), or differences in sequence separation of the
	residues in the different sets. In order to overcome these limits,
	we compare the degree of clustering of the conserved positions on
	the native structure and on alternative conformations generated by
	the de novo structure prediction method Rosetta. For 65% of the 79
	proteins, the conserved residues are significantly more clustered
	in the native structure than in the alternative conformations, indicating
	that the clustering of conserved residues in protein structures goes
	beyond that expected purely from sequence locality and composition
	effects. The differences in the spatial distribution of conserved
	residues can be utilized in de novo protein structure prediction:
	We find that for 79% of the proteins, selection of the Rosetta generated
	conformations with the greatest clustering of the conserved residues
	significantly enriches the fraction of close-to-native structures.},

	where each of them came under the control of a strong tac promoter.
	This was designed to achieve equal over-expression of both genes

	The fractional distribution of homo- and hetero-dimers was in accord

	a homo-dimer, the H439Q mutation leads to a big fall in the value

	chemical reactions and other electronic processes, such as charge

	large biomolecules the logical approach is to combine the two techniques
	and to use a QM method for the chemically active region (e.g., substrates

	the surroundings (e.g., protein and solvent). The resulting schemes

	with batch experiments, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform
	infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
	(XPS). The N 1s line in XPS spectra showed deprotonation of the amine
	group of PMG (NH2+) with increasing pH. IR analyses showed no evidence
	for the interaction of PMG's carboxylate group with the goethite
	surface, while the phosphonate group formed inner-sphere complexes.
	There is evidence for intramolecular hydrogen bonding between NH2+
	and both the carboxylate and the phosphonate groups at low pH. Intramolecular
	hydrogen bonding is lost when the amine group is deprotonated, and
	the trend in intramolecular hydrogen bonding between NH2+ and phosphonate
	shows that PMG adsorbs via predominantly monodentate complexation.
	A minor quantity of bidentate complexes is thought to form both at
	near-neutral pH and when the surface concentration of PMG is low.
	While the phosphonate group of PMG binds directly, the carboxylate
	group remains relatively "free" from complexation with goethite,
	leaving it subject to degradation and/or complexation with metal

	a model for simulating the transport of CO2 and tracers in the ocean
	(HILDA, for High-Latitude Exchange/Interior Diffusion-Advection Model)
	that combines features of box models and of the box-diffusion model.
	It is latitudinally divided into two zones; in the low latitudes,
	transport into the deep ocean occurs by eddy diffusion, while the
	high-latitude zone consists of two boxes (surface and deep ocean).
	We compare different ways of calibration and find that in order to
	reproduce the distributions of natural 14C as well as of bomb-produced
	14C, the vertical eddy diffusivity K must decrease with depth. The
	concept of eddy diffusion is discussed by calculating apparent eddy
	diffusivities from 3-D model tracer simulations. The depth dependence
	of K is qualitatively confirmed by these calculations, reflecting
	the fact that the water circulation is more vigorous near the surface
	than at depth. We find that eddy diffusivities derived from 14C are
	not appropriate for representing the large-scale vertical temperature
	distribution, because the latitudinal distribution of temperature
	differs in a systematic way from that of 14C and also of anthropogenic
	CO2. Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2, biospheric CO2 emissions
	and isotopic perturbations are calculated, based on the observed
	atmospheric CO2concentration history. The results indicate an oceanic
	uptake of 1.9 Gt C yr?1 in 1980 and a near-zero net contribution
	from the biota in the past several decades. The HILDA model is compared
	with other models, and we find that its response to atmospheric CO2
	perturbations is rather similar to that of a 3-D ocean carbon cycle
	model of Sarmiento etÂ al. (1992).}

  abstract = {To generate structures consistent with both the local and nonlocal
	interactions responsible for protein stability, 3 and 9 residue fragments
	of known structures with local sequences similar to the target sequence
	were assembled into complete tertiary structures using a Monte Carlo
	simulated annealing procedure (Simons et al., J Mol Biol 1997; 268:209-225).
	The scoring function used in the simulated annealing procedure consists
	of sequence-dependent terms representing hydrophobic burial and specific
	pair interactions such as electrostatics and disulfide bonding and
	sequence-independent terms representing hard sphere packing, alpha-helix
	and beta-strand packing, and the collection of beta-strands in beta-sheets
	(Simons et al., Proteins 1999;34:82-95). For each of 21 small, ab
	initio targets, 1,200 final structures were constructed, each the
	result of 100,000 attempted fragment substitutions. The five structures
	submitted for the CASP III experiment were chosen from the approximately
	25 structures with the lowest scores in the broadest minima (assessed
	through the number of structural neighbors; Shortle et al., Proc
	Natl Acad Sci USA 1998;95:1158-1162). The results were encouraging:
	highlights of the predictions include a 99-residue segment for MarA
	with an rmsd of 6.4 A to the native structure, a 95-residue (full
	length) prediction for the EH2 domain of EPS15 with an rmsd of 6.0
	A, a 75-residue segment of DNAB helicase with an rmsd of 4.7 A, and
	a 67-residue segment of ribosomal protein L30 with an rmsd of 3.8

	at pH 7.5 were near unity due to the large forward commitment to
	catalysis. Intrinsic KIEs were expressed by increasing the pH to
	8.5. Intrinsic KIEs from MTAs labeled at 1'-(3)H, 1'-(14)C, 2'-(3)H,

	undergoes a dissociative (D(N)A(N)) (S(N)1) mechanism with little
	involvement of the leaving group or participation of the attacking
	nucleophile at the transition state, causing the transition state
	to have significant ribooxacarbenium ion character. A transition
	state constrained to match the intrinsic KIEs was located with density
	functional theory [B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)]. The leaving group (N9) is predicted
	to be 3.0 A from the anomeric carbon. The small beta-secondary 2'-(3)H
	KIE of 1.044 corresponds to a modest 3'-endo conformation for ribose
	and a H1'-C1'-C2'-H2' dihedral angle of 53 degrees at the transition
	state. Natural bond orbital analysis of the substrate and the transition
	state suggests that the 4'-(3)H KIE is due to hyperconjugation between
	the lone pair (n(p)) of O3' and the antibonding (sigma) orbital of
	the C4'-H4' group, and the methyl-(3)H(3) KIE is due to hyperconjugation
	between the n(p) of sulfur and the sigma of methyl C-H bonds. Transition
	state analogues that resemble this transition state structure are
	powerful inhibitors, and their molecular electrostatic potential
	maps closely resemble that of the transition state.},

	a single template for which Zstruct < Z < Zgood. PROSPECTOR_3 was
	applied to a comprehensive Protein Data Bank (PDB) benchmark composed
	of 1491 single domain proteins, 41â€“200 residues long and no more
	than 30% identical to any threading template. Of the proteins, 878
	were found to be easy targets, with 761 having a root mean square

	growth. The role of MreB in defining R. sphaeroides shape was therefore
	investigated. Attempts at deleting or insertionally inactivating

	microscopy showed MreB localized to mid-cell in elongating cells

	reconstruction showed that MreB formed a ring at mid-cell. MreB remained
	at mid-cell as septation began but localized to new sites in the
	daughter cells before the completion of septation. MreB localized
	to putative septation sites in cephalexin-treated filamentous cells.
	Genomic single-copy mreB was replaced with gfp-mreB, and green fluorescent

	in the apo form, in complex with an Ala-AMP analog, and in a high-resolution
	lysine-methylated form. The structures show docking of the editing
	domain to the activation domain opposite from the predicted tRNA-binding
	surface. Thus, the editing site is positioned >35 A from the activation
	site, prompting us to model 2 different tRNA complexes: one binding
	tRNA at the activation site, and the other binding tRNA at the editing
	site. Interestingly, a gel-shift assay also implies the presence
	of 2 types of tRNA complex with different mobility. These results
	suggest that tRNA translocation via a canonical CCA flipping is unlikely

  abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not
	only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for
	irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes
	place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely
	irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation
	of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative
	forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the
	ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly
	for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts
	that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
	increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume
	(ppmv) to a peak of 450â€“600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible
	dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those
	of the â€œdust bowlâ€? era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal
	expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit
	to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4â€“1.0
	m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6â€“1.9
	m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding ?1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions

	Structures of the wild type and its organophilic and thermophilic

	further beneficial mutations in later generations. The mutations
	exert their influence on the esterase structure over large distances,
	in a manner that would be difficult to predict. The loops with the
	largest structural changes generally are not the sites of mutations.
	Similarly, none of the seven amino acid substitutions in the organophile
	are in the active site, even though the enzyme experiences significant
	changes in the organization of this site. In addition to reduction
	of surface loop flexibility, thermostability in the evolved esterase
	results from altered core packing, helix stabilization, and the acquisition
	of surface salt bridges, in agreement with other comparative studies
	of mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes. Crystallographic analysis
	of the wild type and its evolved counterparts reveals networks of
	mutations that collectively reorganize the active site. Interestingly,
	the changes that led to diversity within the alpha/beta hydrolase

	duration fluctuations (3 weeks of -5 Â°C followed by 3 weeks of +5

	through measurements of the mineralized fraction (14CO2), soil water
	fraction, KOH extractable fraction, and non-extractable fraction.
	Microbial parameters used to characterize the soils were estimates
	of size of microbial biomass, overall microbial activity and microbial
	diversity. The constant freezing treatment exhibited the lowest amount
	of glyphosate mineralization. The constant thawed treatment and the
	treatments with fluctuating temperature exhibited significantly increased
	mineralization. These results were in accordance with the observed
	concentration of glyphosate in soil water; the higher the activity,
	the lower the concentration. The amount of glyphosate extractable
	with KOH and the resulting non-extractable fraction, however, were
	not significantly affected by soil type or temperature regime. The
	glyphosate mineralization pattern was comparable with the overall

  abstract = {Protein structure prediction encompasses two major challenges: 1),
	the generation of a large ensemble of high resolution structures
	for a given amino-acid sequence; and 2), the identification of the
	structure closest to the native structure for a blind prediction.
	In this article, we address the second challenge, by proposing what
	is, to our knowledge, a novel iterative traveling-salesman problem-based
	clustering method to identify the structures of a protein, in a given
	ensemble, which are closest to the native structure. The method consists
	of an iterative procedure, which aims at eliminating clusters of
	structures at each iteration, which are unlikely to be of similar
	fold to the native, based on a statistical analysis of cluster density
	and average spherical radius. The method, denoted as ICON, has been
	tested on four data sets: 1), 1400 proteins with high resolution
	decoys; 2), medium-to-low resolution decoys from Decoys 'R' Us; 3),
	medium-to-low resolution decoys from the first-principles approach,
	ASTRO-FOLD; and 4), selected targets from CASP8. The extensive tests
	demonstrate that ICON can identify high-quality structures in each
	ensemble, regardless of the resolution of conformers. In a total
	of 1454 proteins, with an average of 1051 conformers per protein,
	the conformers selected by ICON are, on an average, in the top 3.5%
	of the conformers in the ensemble.},

  abstract = {The prediction of the correct ?-sheet topology for pure ? and mixed
	?/? proteins is a critical intermediate step toward the three dimensional
	protein structure prediction. The predicted beta sheet topology provides
	distance constraints between sequentially separated residues, which
	reduces the three dimensional search space for a protein structure
	prediction algorithm. Here, we present a novel mixed integer linear
	optimization based framework for the prediction of ?-sheet topology
	in ? and mixed ?/? proteins. The objective is to maximize the total
	strand-to-strand contact potential of the protein. A large number
	of physical constraints are applied to provide biologically meaningful
	topology results. The formulation permits the creation of a rank-ordered
	list of preferred ?-sheet arrangements. Finally, the generated topologies
	are re-ranked using a fully atomistic approach involving torsion
	angle dynamics and clustering. For a large, non-redundant data set
	of 2102 ? and mixed ?/? proteins with at least 3 strands taken from
	the PDB, the proposed approach provides the top 5 solutions with
	average precision and recall greater than 78\%. Consistent results
	are obtained in the ?-sheet topology prediction for blind targets
	provided during the CASP8 and CASP9 experiments, as well as for actual
	and predicted secondary structures. The ?-sheet topology prediction
	algorithm, BeST, is available to the scientific community at http://selene.princeton.edu/BeST/.},

	biology has been accompanied by a proliferation of software tools,
	data formats, analytical techniques and web servers. This brings
	with it the challenge of integrating phylogenetic and other related
	biological data found in a wide variety of formats, and underlines
	the need for reusable software that can read, manipulate and transform
	this information into the various forms required to build computational
	pipelines. RESULTS: We built a Python software library for working
	with phylogenetic data that is tightly integrated with Biopython,
	a broad-ranging toolkit for computational biology. Our library, Bio.Phylo,
	is highly interoperable with existing libraries, tools and standards,
	and is capable of parsing common file formats for phylogenetic trees,
	performing basic transformations and manipulations, attaching rich
	annotations, and visualizing trees. We unified the modules for working
	with the standard file formats Newick, NEXUS and phyloXML behind
	a consistent and simple API, providing a common set of functionality
	independent of the data source. CONCLUSIONS: Bio.Phylo meets a growing
	need in bioinformatics for working with heterogeneous types of phylogenetic
	data. By supporting interoperability with multiple file formats and
	leveraging existing Biopython features, this library simplifies the
	construction of phylogenetic workflows. We also provide examples
	of the benefits of building a community around a shared open-source
	project. Bio.Phylo is included with Biopython, available through
	the Biopython website, http://biopython.org.},

	In the "transgenic" complexes, the conformation remains closer to
	that of the human complex, the protein-ligand interactions are improved,
	and the affinity for compstatin becomes "human-like." The present

	In this study, we developed Con A-immobilized magnetic nanoparticles

	expression specifically in response to D-arabinose and not the native

	Mutations were targeted in the ligand-binding pocket and on the AraC

	or activating conformations in the absence or presence of effector,
	respectively. In this study, we analyze the contributions of individual
	mutations toward the overall mutant functions in an attempt to streamline
	future AraC design efforts. For a variety of point mutants, we quantify
	the induced expression response to D-arabinose (level of leaky expression,
	induction fold, half-maximal dose response, and effector specificity)
	and the binding affinity of the purified ligand-binding domain for
	D-arabinose. We find that mutations introduced in the N-terminal
	arm (design Position 8) strengthen the induction response, most likely
	by weakening interactions with the DNA-binding domain, but are not
	involved in ligand binding. Meanwhile, binding pocket mutations occurring
	further away from the arm (Positions 80 and 82) primarily contribute
	to maintaining repression in the absence of effector and do not show
	response to D-arabinose without the accompanying mutations. Combinations
	of mutations cooperatively couple molecular recognition to transcriptional
	activation, demonstrating the complexity of the AraC regulatory switch
	and the power of combinatorial protein design to alter effector specificity

	the 2'-phosphate (2'-P) NADP+ binding region, and also suggested
	that other regions must undergo structural rearrangements of the
	protein backbone during coenzyme binding. Among the residues involved
	in such specificity could be those located in regions where interaction
	with the pyrophosphate group of the coenzyme takes place, namely
	loops 155-160 and 261-268 in Anabaena FNR. In order to learn more
	about the coenzyme specificity determinants, and to better define
	the structural basis of coenzyme binding, mutations in the pyrophosphate
	and 2'-P binding regions of FNR have been introduced. Modification
	of the pyrophosphate binding region, involving residues Thr-155,
	Ala-160, and Leu-263, indicates that this region is involved in determining
	coenzyme specificity and that selected alterations of these positions
	produce FNR enzymes that are able to bind NAD+. Thus, our results
	suggest that slightly different structural rearrangements of the
	backbone chain in the pyrophosphate binding region might determine
	FNR specificity for the coenzyme. Combined mutations at the 2'-P
	binding region, involving residues Ser-223, Arg-224, Arg-233, and
	Tyr-235, in combination with the residues mentioned above in the
	pyrophosphate binding region have also been carried out in an attempt

	analyzed mutants lost the ability for NADP+/H binding and electron
	transfer, and no major improvements were observed with regard to
	the efficiency of the reactions with NAD+/H. Therefore, our results
	confirm that determinants for coenzyme specificity in FNR are also
	situated in the pyrophosphate binding region and not only in the
	2'-P binding region. Such observations also suggest that other regions

  abstract = {Horizontal transfer (HT) of genes is known to be an important mechanism
	of genetic innovation, especially in prokaryotes. The impact of HT
	of transposable elements (TEs), however, has only recently begun
	to receive widespread attention and may be significant due to their
	mutagenic potential, inherent mobility, and abundance. Helitrons,
	also known as rolling-circle transposons, are a distinctive subclass
	of TE with a unique transposition mechanism. Here, we describe the
	first evidence for the repeated HT of four different families of
	Helitrons in an unprecedented array of organisms, including mammals,
	reptiles, fish, invertebrates, and insect viruses. The Helitrons
	present in these species have a patchy distribution and are closely
	related (80Ã¢â‚¬â€œ98% sequence identity), despite the deep divergence
	times among hosts. Multiple lines of evidence indicate the extreme
	conservation of sequence identity is not due to selection, including
	the highly fragmented nature of the Helitrons identified and the
	lack of any signatures of selection at the nucleotide level. The
	presence of horizontally transferred Helitrons in insect viruses,
	in particular, suggests that this may represent a potential mechanism
	of transfer in some taxa. Unlike genes, Helitrons that have horizontally
	transferred into new host genomes can amplify, in some cases reaching
	up to several hundred copies and representing a substantial fraction
	of the genome. Because Helitrons are known to frequently capture
	and amplify gene fragments, HT of this unique group of DNA transposons
	could lead to horizontal gene transfer and incur dramatic shifts
	in the trajectory of genome evolution.}

  abstract = {We report a novel sol-gel dip-coating process to form dual-layer microporous

	First, we deposit a surfactant-templated silica (STS) intermediate
	layer on top of a commercial gamma-alumina support both to improve
	its 'surface finish' and to prevent a subsequently deposited microporous
	overlayer from penetrating into the support. Second, membranes are
	processed under clean room conditions to avoid dust contamination,
	and third, membranes are vacuum-calcined to promote further pore
	shrinkage and impart surface hydrophobicity. The resulting asymmetric
	membrane exhibits a gradual change in pore diameter from 50 Angstrom
	(gamma-alumina support layer) to 10-12 Angstrom (STS intermediate
	layer), and then to 3-4 Angstrom (30 nm thick, ultramicroporous silica
	top-layer). Compared to a single-layer process using only the microporous
	overlayer, the dual-layer process improves both flux and selectivity.
	For the industrially important problem of natural gas purification,
	the combined CO2 flux ((3-0.5)x 10(-4) cm(3)(STP)/s/cm(2)/cm Hg)
	and CO2/CH4 separation factors (200-600) are superior to all previously
	reported values for the separation of a 50/50 (v/v) CO2/CH4 gas mixture.
	In addition, the membrane selectively separated hydrogen from a simulated
	reformate from partial oxidation of methanol as evidenced by a high
	concentration of hydrogen recovery. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

	the most abundant intracellular folate, and could not utilize exogenous

  abstract = {An approach to loop prediction that starts with a database search
	is presented and analyzed. To obtain meaningful statistics, 130 loops
	from 21 proteins were studied. The correlation between the internal
	conformation of the loop and the conformation of the neighboring
	stem residues was examined. Distances between C(alpha) and C(beta)
	of the immediate neighbor residues at each end select template loops
	as well as more complex (e.g. three residues on either side) matching
	criteria. To have a high probability that the best possible loop
	candidate in the database is included in the set, relatively large
	cutoffs for matching the interatomic distances of the stem residues
	have to be used in the template loop selection procedure; for loops
	of length 5, this results in an average of 1000 loops and for loops
	of length 9, the number is about 1500. The required number increases
	only slowly with loop length, in contrast to the exponential time
	increase involved in direct searches of the conformational space.
	The best loops among the large number of candidates can be determined
	by ranking them with the standard CHARMM non-bonded energy function
	(without electrostatics) applied to the backbone and C(beta) atoms.
	The same representation (backbone plus C(beta)) can be used to optimize
	the loop orientations relative to the rest of the protein by constrained
	energy minimization. Target loops that have many non-bonded contacts
	with the protein yield better results so that analysis of the non-bonded
	contacts of the selected template loops is useful in determining
	the expected accuracy of a prediction. The method for loop selection
	and optimization predicted eight (out of 18) loops of up to nine
	residues to an RMSD better than 1.07 A relative to the crystal structure;
	for 17 of the 18 loops, one of the three lowest energy template loops
	had an RMSD of less than 1.79 A. The prediction of antibody loops
	from a database search is more effective than that for non-antibody
	loops. Provided that they belong to one of the canonical classes,
	very similar antibody loops are certain to exist in the database.
	Superposition of the stem residues for antibody loops also results
	in a better orientation than with arbitrary target loops because
	the neighboring residues tend to have a more similar beta-strand
	structure. Two H3 loops (for which no canonical structures have been
	proposed) were predicted with reasonable accuracy (RMSD of 0.49 A
	and 1.07 A) even though no corresponding antibody loops were in the
	database.},

	populations to adapt to diverse environments. However, genomic diversity
	is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do
	not easily arise on practical timescales. Although in vitro and directed
	evolution methods have created genetic variants with usefully altered
	phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation
	of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed
	evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex
	automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale programming and
	evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on
	the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population
	of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because
	the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices
	that automate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous
	generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions,
	deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate
	(DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the
	industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components
	in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool
	of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic
	variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase
	in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over
	existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach
	embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the
	design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties.},

  abstract = {Aqueous solubility is one of the major physiochemical properties to
	be optimized in drug discovery. It is related to absorption and distribution
	in the ADME-Tox (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion,
	and Toxicity). Aqueous solubility and membrane permeability are the
	two key factors that affect a drug's oral bioavailability. Because
	of the importance of aqueous solubility, a lot of efforts have been
	spent on developing reliable models to predict this physiochemical
	property. Although some progress has been made and a lot of models
	have been constructed, it is concluded that accurate and reliable
	aqueous models targeted to predict solubility of drug-like molecules,
	have not emerged based on the outcome of an aqueous solubility prediction
	campaign sponsored by Goodman et al. In this review paper, we provide
	a snapshot of the latest development in the field. The challenges
	of developing high quality aqueous solubility models as well as the
	strategies of surmounting those challenges have been discussed. We
	conclude that the biggest challenge of modeling aqueous solubility
	is to collect more high quality, unskewed and drug-relevant solubility
	data which are sufficient diverse to cover most the chemical space
	of drugs. The second challenge is to develop good descriptors to
	account for the lattice energy of solvation. In order to develop
	accurate and predictable in silico solubility models, the key is
	to collect a sufficient number of high quality experimental data
	and the suspicious data must be verified. In addition, the molecular
	descriptors must be relevant to the energies in the solvation process
	(the lattice energy for crystal packing, the energy of forming cavity
	in solvent, and the solvation energy), and the models must be carefully
	cross-validated and evaluated using the external data sets.},

	to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement
	of 0.26 Ã…, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field
	(0.25 Ã…) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44

	on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular
	energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements
	and relative energies were 0.25 Ã… and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively.
	These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Ã… and

	pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The

	In this study, dihydrofolate reductase, a small monomeric protein

	to address this question. Experimental and computational studies
	have proposed a dynamic network that includes two residues remote
	from the active site (G121 and M42). The current study compares the
	nature of the H-transfer step of the WT enzyme, two single mutants,
	and their double mutant. The contribution of quantum mechanical tunneling
	and enzyme dynamics to the H-transfer step was examined by determining
	intrinsic kinetic isotope effects, their temperature dependence,
	and activation parameters. Different patterns of environmentally
	coupled tunneling were found for these four enzymes. The findings
	indicate that the naturally evolved WT dihydrofolate reductase requires
	no donor-acceptor distance fluctuations (no gating). Both single
	mutations affect the rearrangement of the system before tunneling,
	so some gating is required, but the overall nature of the environmentally
	coupled tunneling appears similar to that of the WT enzyme. The double
	mutation, on the other hand, seems to cause a major change in the
	nature of H transfer, leading to poor reorganization and substantial
	gating. These findings support the suggestion that these distal residues
	synergistically affect the H transfer at the active site of the enzyme.
	This observation is in accordance with the notion that these remote
	residues are part of a dynamic network that is coupled to the catalyzed

	scoring functions (DrugScore and X-Score). These scoring functions
	are not tested in the context of a particular docking program. Instead,
	conformational sampling and scoring are separated into two consecutive
	steps. First, an exhaustive conformational sampling is performed
	by using the AutoDock program to generate an ensemble of docked conformations
	for each ligand molecule. This conformational ensemble is required
	to cover the entire conformational space as much as possible rather
	than to focus on a few energy minima. Then, each scoring function
	is applied to score this conformational ensemble to see if it can
	identify the experimentally observed conformation from all of the
	other decoys. Among all of the scoring functions under test, six
	of them, i.e., PLP, F-Score, LigScore, DrugScore, LUDI, and X-Score,
	yield success rates higher than the AutoDock scoring function. The
	success rates of these six scoring functions range from 66% to 76%

	attention to evolutionary constraints. It is pointed out that enzyme
	catalysis reflects energy contributions that cannot be determined
	uniquely by current experimental approaches without augmenting the
	analysis by computer simulation studies. The use of energy considerations
	and computer simulations allows one to exclude many of the popular
	proposals for the way enzymes work. It appears that the standard
	approaches used by organic chemists to catalyze reactions in solutions
	are not used by enzymes. This point is illustrated by considering
	the desolvation hypothesis and showing that it cannot account for
	a large increase in kcat relative to the corresponding kcage for
	the reference reaction in a solvent cage. The problems associated
	with other frequently invoked mechanisms also are outlined. Furthermore,
	it is pointed out that mutation studies are inconsistent with ground
	state destabilization mechanisms. After considering factors that
	were not optimized by evolution, we review computer simulation studies
	that reproduced the overall catalytic effect of different enzymes.
	These studies pointed toward electrostatic effects as the most important
	catalytic contributions. The nature of this electrostatic stabilization
	mechanism is far from being obvious because the electrostatic interaction
	between the reacting system and the surrounding area is similar in
	enzymes and in solution. However, the difference is that enzymes
	have a preorganized dipolar environment that does not have to pay
	the reorganization energy for stabilizing the relevant transition
	states. Apparently, the catalytic power of enzymes is stored in their
	folding energy in the form of the preorganized polar environment.},

	proposed to occur in the hormone-receptor complex. Additional evidence
	for multiple conformations in solution is provided by comparative
	studies of an insulin analogue containing a peptide bond between
	residues B29 and A1 (mini-proinsulin). This analogue forms dimers
	and higher-order oligomers under conditions in which native insulin
	is monomeric, suggesting that the B29-A1 peptide bond stabilizes
	a conformational substate favorable for dimerization. Such stabilization
	is not observed in corresponding studies of native proinsulin, in
	which a 35-residue connecting peptide joins residues B30 and A1;
	this extended tether is presumably too flexible to constrain the
	conformation of the B-chain. The differences between proinsulin and
	mini-proinsulin suggest a structural mechanism for the observation

	proinsulin to form the correct pattern of disulfide bonds. These

	predicted for the excluded-volume interaction between a spherical
	protein solute A and a random-flight representation of the polymeric
	cosolute P. That model of the protein-polymer interaction is also
	shown to provide a reasonable description of published gel chromatographic
	and equilibrium dialysis data on the effect of polymer molecular
	mass on BAP for human serum albumin in the presence of polyethylene
	glycols, a contrary finding from analysis of albumin solubility measurements
	being rejected on theoretical grounds. Inverse dependence upon polymer
	chainlength is also the predicted excluded-volume effect on the strength
	of several types of macromolecular equilibria-protein isomerization,
	protein dimerization, and 1:1 complex formation between dissimilar
	protein reactants. It is therefore concluded that published experimental
	observations of the reverse dependence, preferential reaction enhancement
	within DNA replication complexes by larger polyethylene glycols,
	must reflect the consequences of cosolute chemical interactions that
	outweigh those of thermodynamic nonideality arising from excluded-volume
	effects.},

	The method is based on a procedure that generates a set of conformations,
	each with its own force-field energy, but adds a term to this energy
	that favors conformations that are close in structure (have a low
	rmsd) to other conformations. The sum of the force-field energy and
	rmsd-dependent term is defined here as the "colony energy" of a given
	conformation, because each conformation that is generated is viewed
	as representing a colony of points. The use of the colony energy
	tends to select conformations that are located in broad energy basins.
	The approach is applied to the ab initio prediction of the conformations
	of all of the loops in a dataset of 135 nonredundant proteins. By
	using an rmsd from a native criterion based on the superposition
	of loop stems, the average rmsd of 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8-residue long
	loops is 0.85, 0.92, 1.23, and 1.45 A, respectively. For 8-residue
	loops, 60 of 61 predictions have an rmsd of less than 3.0 A. The

  abstract = {Motivation: A number of studies of individual proteins have shown
	that post-translational modifications (PTMs) are associated with
	structural rearrangements of their target proteins. Although such
	studies provide critical insights into the mechanics behind the dynamic
	regulation of protein function, they usually feature examples with
	relatively large conformational changes. However, with the steady
	growth of Protein Data Bank (PDB) and available PTM sites, it is
	now possible to more systematically characterize the role of PTMs
	as conformational switches. In this study, we ask (1) what is the
	expected extent of structural change upon PTM, (2) how often are
	those changes in fact substantial, (3) whether the structural impact
	is spatially localized or global and (4) whether different PTMs have
	different signatures.Results: We exploit redundancy in PDB and, using
	root-mean-square deviation, study the conformational heterogeneity
	of groups of protein structures corresponding to identical sequences
	in their unmodified and modified forms. We primarily focus on the
	two most abundant PTMs in PDB, glycosylation and phosphorylation,
	but show that acetylation and methylation have similar tendencies.
	Our results provide evidence that PTMs induce conformational changes
	at both local and global level. However, the proportion of large
	changes is unexpectedly small; only 7% of glycosylated and 13% of
	phosphorylated proteins undergo global changes >2 Å. Further analysis
	suggests that phosphorylation stabilizes protein structure by reducing
	global conformational heterogeneity by 25%. Overall, these results
	suggest a subtle but common role of allostery in the mechanisms through
	which PTMs affect regulatory and signaling pathways.Contact: predrag@indiana.eduSupplementary

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel linear programming approach to do protein
	3-dimensional (3D) structure prediction via threading. Based on the
	contact map graph of the protein 3D structure template, the protein
	threading problem is formulated as a large scale integer programming
	(IP) problem. The IP formulation is then relaxed to a linear programming
	(LP) problem, and then solved by the canonical branch-and-bound method.
	The final solution is globally optimal with respect to energy functions.
	In particular, our energy function includes pairwise interaction
	preferences and allowing variable gaps which are two key factors
	in making the protein threading problem NP-hard. A surprising result
	is that, most of the time, the relaxed linear programs generate integral
	solutions directly. Our algorithm has been implemented as a software
	package RAPTOR-RApid Protein Threading by Operation Research technique.
	Large scale benchmark test for fold recognition shows that RAPTOR
	significantly outperforms other programs at the fold similarity level.
	The CAFASP3 evaluation, a blind and public test by the protein structure
	prediction community, ranks RAPTOR as top 1, among individual prediction
	servers, in terms of the recognition capability and alignment accuracy
	for Fold Recognition (FR) family targets. RAPTOR also performs very
	well in recognizing the hard Homology Modeling (HM) targets. RAPTOR

	atom-typer for CHARMM (MATCH) for the automated assignment of atom
	types and force field parameters for molecular mechanics simulation
	of organic molecules. The toolset includes utilities for the conversion
	of multiple chemical structure file formats into a molecular graph.
	A general chemical pattern-matching engine using this graph has been
	implemented whereby assignment of molecular mechanics atom types,
	charges, and force field parameters are achieved by comparison against
	a customizable list of chemical fragments. While initially designed
	to complement the CHARMM simulation package and force fields by generating
	the necessary input topology and atom-type data files, MATCH can
	be expanded to any force field and program, and has core functionality
	that makes it extendable to other applications such as fragment-based
	property prediction. In this work, we demonstrate the accurate construction
	of atomic parameters of molecules within each force field included
	in CHARMM36 through exhaustive cross validation studies illustrating
	that bond charge increment rules derived from one force field can
	be transferred to another. In addition, using leave-one-out substitution
	it is shown that it is also possible to substitute missing intra
	and intermolecular parameters with ones included in a force field
	to complete the parameterization of novel molecules. Finally, to
	demonstrate the robustness of MATCH and the coverage of chemical
	space offered by the recent CHARMM general force field (Vanommeslaeghe,
	et al., J Comput Chem 2010, 31, 671), one million molecules from
	the PubChem database of small molecules are typed, parameterized,
	and minimized.},

  abstract = {The conformations of loops are determined by the water-mediated interactions
	between amino acid residues. Energy functions that describe the interactions
	can be derived either from physical principles (physical-based energy
	function) or statistical analysis of known protein structures (knowledge-based
	statistical potentials). It is commonly believed that statistical
	potentials are appropriate for coarse-grained representation of proteins
	but are not as accurate as physical-based potentials when atomic
	resolution is required. Several recent applications of physical-based
	energy functions to loop selections appear to support this view.
	In this article, we apply a recently developed DFIRE-based statistical
	potential to three different loop decoy sets (RAPPER, Jacobson, and
	Forrest-Woolf sets). Together with a rotamer library for side-chain
	optimization, the performance of DFIRE-based potential in the RAPPER
	decoy set (385 loop targets) is comparable to that of AMBER/GBSA
	for short loops (two to eight residues). The DFIRE is more accurate
	for longer loops (9 to 12 residues). Similar trend is observed when
	comparing DFIRE with another physical-based OPLS/SGB-NP energy function
	in the large Jacobson decoy set (788 loop targets). In the Forrest-Woolf
	decoy set for the loops of membrane proteins, the DFIRE potential
	performs substantially better than the combination of the CHARMM
	force field with several solvation models. The results suggest that
	a single-term DFIRE-statistical energy function can provide an accurate
	loop prediction at a fraction of computing cost required for more
	complicate physical-based energy functions. A Web server for academic

	for NADP(+) over NAD(+). By mutation of a single threonine residue
	(Thr175) immediately downstream of the beta(B) strand in the Rossmann
	fold, the nucleotide specificity of Vh-ALDH has been changed from
	NADP(+) to NAD(+). Replacement of Thr175 by a negatively charged
	residue (Asp or Glu) resulted in an increase in k(cat)/K(m) for NAD(+)
	relative to that for NADP(+) of up to 5000-fold due to a decrease
	for NAD(+) and an increase for NADP(+) in their respective Michaelis
	constants (K(a)). Differential protection by NAD(+) and NADP(+) against
	thermal inactivation and comparison of the dissociation constants
	of NMN, 2'-AMP, 2'5'-ADP, and 5'-AMP for these mutants and the wild-type
	enzyme clearly support the change in nucleotide specificity. Moreover,
	replacement of Thr175 with polar residues (N, S, or Q) demonstrated
	that a more efficient NAD(+)-dependent enzyme T175Q could be created
	without loss of NADP(+)-dependent activity. Analysis of the three-dimensional
	structure of Vh-ALDH with bound NADP(+) showed that the hydroxyl
	group of Thr175 forms a hydrogen bond to the 2'-phosphate of NADP(+).
	Replacement with glutamic acid or glutamine strengthened interactions
	with NAD(+) and indicated why threonine would be the preferred polar
	residue at the nucleotide recognition site in NADP(+)-specific aldehyde
	dehydrogenases. These results have shown that the size and the structure
	of the residue at the nucleotide recognition site play the key roles
	in differentiating between NAD(+) and NADP(+) interactions while
	the presence of a negative charge is responsible for the decrease

	by I-TASSER assembly refinement. Compared to the traditional threading
	assembly refinement procedures, the inclusion of the threading-constrained
	ab initio folding models can consistently improve the quality of
	the full-length models as assessed by the GDT-HA and hydrogen-bonding

  abstract = {Protein folding is regarded as a quantum transition between the torsion
	states of a polypeptide chain. According to the quantum theory of
	conformational dynamics, we propose the dynamical contact order (DCO)
	defined as a characteristic of the contact described by the moment
	of inertia and the torsion potential energy of the polypeptide chain
	between contact residues. Consequently, the protein folding rate
	can be quantitatively studied from the point of view of dynamics.
	By comparing theoretical calculations and experimental data on the
	folding rate of 80 proteins, we successfully validate the view that
	protein folding is a quantum conformational transition. We conclude
	that (i) a correlation between the protein folding rate and the contact
	inertial moment exists; (ii) multi-state protein folding can be regarded
	as a quantum conformational transition similar to that of two-state
	proteins but with an intermediate delay. We have estimated the order
	of magnitude of the time delay; (iii) folding can be classified into
	two types, exergonic and endergonic. Most of the two-state proteins
	with higher folding rate are exergonic and most of the multi-state
	proteins with low folding rate are endergonic. The folding speed
	limit is determined by exergonic folding.},

	structure pairs. Second, rather than setting specific distance cutoffs
	and calculating only the fractions with errors below the cutoff,
	all residue pairs in alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed
	score. For comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed
	a large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489 small
	to medium size proteins using the threading program PROSPECTOR_3
	and built the full-length models using MODELLER and TASSER. The TM-score
	of the initial threading alignments, compared to the GDT and MaxSub
	scoring functions, shows a much stronger correlation to the quality
	of the final full-length models. The TM-score is further exploited
	as an assessment of all 'new fold' targets in the recent CASP5 experiment
	and shows a close coincidence with the results of human-expert visual
	assessment. These data suggest that the TM-score is a useful complement
	to the fully automated assessment of protein structure predictions.

  abstract = {The interaction of dihydrofolate (H(2)F) and NADPH with a fluorescent
	derivative of H(2)F reductase (DHFR) was studied by using transient
	and single-molecule techniques. The fluorescent moiety Alexa 488
	was attached to the structural loop that closes over the substrates
	after they are bound. Fluorescence quenching was found to accompany
	the binding of both substrates and the hydride transfer reaction.
	For the binding of H(2)F to DHFR, the simplest mechanism consistent
	with the data postulates that the enzyme exists as slowly interconverting
	conformers, with the substrate binding preferentially to one of the
	conformers. At pH 7.0, the binding reaction has a bimolecular rate
	constant of 1.8 x 10(7) M(-1).s(-1), and the formation of the initial
	complex is followed by a conformational change. The binding of NADPH
	to DHFR is more complex and suggests multiple conformers of the enzyme
	exist. NADPH binds to a different conformer than H(2)F with a bimolecular
	rate constant of 2.6-5.7 x 10(6) M(-1).s(-1), with the former value
	obtained from single-molecule kinetics and the latter from stopped-flow
	kinetics. Single-molecule studies of DHFR in equilibrium with substrates
	and products revealed a reaction with ensemble average rate constants
	of 170 and 470 s(-1) at pH 8.5. The former rate constant has an isotope
	effect of >2 when NADPD is substituted for NADPH and probably is
	associated with hydride transfer. The results from stopped-flow and
	single-molecule methods are complementary and demonstrate that multiple
	conformations of both the enzyme and enzyme-substrate complexes exist.},

	The Topt of the evolved enzyme is 17 degrees C higher and its half-life

	100 trajectories of up to one microsecond are performed. Such statistically

	discrete molecular dynamics method with square-well interactions.
	This permits much faster simulations for off-lattice models than

	can be defined, although ensembles with considerable structural variation
	are involved. The large gap models generally fold faster than those
	with a smaller gap. For the large gap models, the kinetic intermediates
	are non-obligatory, while both obligatory and non-obligatory intermediates

	simultaneously the options and constraints of relevant socioeconomic

	Definition of possible scenarios for the use of resources; (2) assessment

	(3) assessment of the implementation suitability; (4) development
	of weight factors for desirability and implementation suitability

  abstract = {The very high concentration of macromolecules within cells can potentially
	have an overwhelming effect on the thermodynamic activity of cellular
	components because of excluded volume effects. To estimate the magnitudes
	of such effects, we have made an experimental study of the cytoplasm
	of Escherichia coli. Parameters from cells and cell extracts are
	used to calculate approximate activity coefficients for cytoplasmic
	conditions. These calculations require a representation of the sizes,
	concentrations and effective specific volumes of the macromolecules
	in the extracts. Macromolecule size representations are obtained
	either by applying a two-phase distribution assay to define a related
	homogeneous solution or by using the molecular mass distribution
	of macromolecules from gel filtration. Macromolecule concentrations
	in cytoplasm are obtained from analyses of extracts by applying a
	correction for the dilution that occurs during extraction. That factor
	is determined from experiments based upon the known impermeability
	of the cytoplasmic volume to sucrose in intact E. coli. Macromolecule
	concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli in either exponential
	or stationary growth phase are estimated to be approximately 0.3
	to 0.4 g/ml. Macromolecule specific volumes are inferred from the
	composition of close-packed precipitates induced by polyethylene
	glycol. Several well-characterized proteins which bind to DNA (lac
	repressor, RNA polymerase) are extremely sensitive to changes in
	salt concentration in studies in vitro, but are insensitive in studies
	in vivo. Application of the activity coefficients from the present
	work indicates that at least part of this discrepancy arises from
	the difference in excluded volumes in these studies. Applications
	of the activity coefficients to solubility or to association reactions
	are also discussed, as are changes associated with cell growth phase
	and osmotic or other effects. The use of solutions of purified macromolecules
	that emulate the crowding conditions inferred for cytoplasm is discussed.},

	a are used to calculate the Boltzmann distribution f = exp(alpha
	- a), the density of entropy levels D(a), the dimensionless chemical
	potential alpha = mu/kT, etc. - The thermodynamics of the ideal gas
	is treated on the basis of entropy quanta by means of the density
	matrix formalism. In this way we obtain the total particle entropy
	A, the thermodynamic entropy S (equation of Sackur-Tetrode), the
	internal and the Helmholtz free energy E and F, respectively, etc.
	Moreover, it can also be shown on the basis of entropy quanta that
	the entropy of a closed system in thermal equilibrium has a maximum
	value, S = S-max. Against this, the entropy S' of an arbitrary non-equilibrium
	state is always smaller, S' < S-max (second law of thermodynamics).
	- Application of ordinary density matrix theory to a closed system
	of N particles leads to the result that the entropy S does not change
	in time, dS/dt = 0, regardless whether we consider an equilibrium
	state, S = S-max, or a non-equilibrium state. S = S'. Consequently,
	S cannot irreversibly change from S' to S-max. However. any irreversible
	process is accompanied by a positive entropy production P = dS/dt
	> 0. In order to overcome this obvious contradiction, we discuss
	the entropy evolution in time by means of the commutator equation
	G = i[P, t], which is deduced from very general assumptions. Here
	P and t are the operators of the entropy production P and the time
	t. Accordingly, P and t do not commute in general, and hence P and
	t are not sharply defined simultaneously. Instead we have uncertainties
	DeltaP and Deltat, which are expressed by the uncertainty relation
	of the N-particle system, DeltaPDeltat greater than or equal to (1
	/2)\(G)\ = (gamma/2)k. This P - t uncertainty relation easily allows
	a discussion of the evolution of the entropy S in time t from S'
	to S-max. Now the irreversible steps are correctly described by the
	entropy production P = dS/dt > 0. and the thermal equilibrium by
	P = 0, Delta P = 0, mid thus the lifetime Deltat = infinity.},

	(MD) in vacuo and the solvent effect is calculated a posteriori by
	solving the Poisson or the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for selected

	linear combination of the buried surface upon complexation, SASbur,
	the electrostatic interaction energy between the ligand and the protein,
	Eelec, and the difference of the solvation free energies of the complex
	and the isolated ligand and protein, deltaGsolv. The method uses
	the buried surface upon complexation to account for the non-polar
	contribution to the binding free energy because it is less sensitive
	to the details of the structure than the van der Waals interaction
	energy. The parameters of the method are developed for a training
	set of 16 HIV-1 protease-inhibitor complexes of known 3D structure.
	A correlation coefficient of 0.91 was obtained with an unsigned mean
	error of 0.8 kcal/mol. When applied to a set of 25 HIV-1 protease-inhibitor

	evidence is presented here for the time constant for interconversion
	of disparate unfolded chain conformations of a small globular protein,
	cytochrome c, in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride denaturant.
	The axial binding reactions of histidine and methionine residues
	with the Fe(II) heme cofactor were monitored with time-resolved magnetic
	circular dichroism spectroscopy after photodissociation of the CO
	complexes of unfolded protein obtained from horse and tuna and from
	several histidine mutants of the horse protein. A kinetic model fitting
	both the reaction rate constants and spectra of the intermediates
	was used to obtain a quantitative estimate of the conformational
	diffusion time. The latter parameter was approximated as a first-order
	time constant for exchange between conformational subensembles presenting
	either a methionine or a histidine residue to the heme iron for facile
	binding. The mean diffusional time constant of the wild type and
	variants was 3 +/- 2 mus, close to the folding "speed limit". The
	implications of the relatively rapid conformational equilibration
	time observed are discussed in terms of the energy landscape and
	classical pathway time regimes of folding, for which the conformational
	diffusion time can be considered a pivot point.},

  abstract = {Part I of this paper (Adjiman et al., 1998a) described the theoretical
	foundations of a global optimization algorithm, the alpha BB algorithm,
	which can be used to solve problems belonging to the broad class
	of twice-differentiable NPLs. For any such problem, the ability to
	automatically generate progressively tighter convex lower bounding
	problems at each iteration guarantees the convergence of the branch-and-bound
	alpha BB algorithm to within epsilon of the global optimum solution.
	Several methods were presented for the construction of valid convex
	underestimators for general nonconvex functions. In this second part,
	the performance of the proposed algorithm and its alternative underestimators
	is studied through their application to a variety of problems. An
	implementation of the alpha BB is described and a number of rules
	for branching variable selection and variable bound updates are shown
	to enhance convergence rates. A user-friendly parser facilitates
	problem input and provides flexibility in the selection of an underestimating
	strategy. In addition, the package features both automatic differentiation
	and interval arithmetic capabilities. Making use of all the available
	options, the alpha BB algorithm successfully identifies the global
	optimum solution of small literature problems, of small and medium
	size chemical engineering problems in the areas of reactors network
	design, heat exchanger network design, reactor-separator network
	design, of generalized geometric programming problems for design
	and control, and of batch process design problems with uncertainty.

	catalyses the oxidation of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes to acids.
	The enzyme is unique compared with other forms of aldehyde dehydrogenase
	in that it exhibits a very high specificity and affinity for the
	cofactor NADP(+). Structural studies of this enzyme and comparisons
	with other forms of aldehyde dehydrogenase provide the basis for
	understanding the molecular features that dictate these unique properties
	and will enhance our understanding of the mechanism of catalysis
	for this class of enzyme. The X-ray structure of aldehyde dehydrogenase
	from V. harveyi has been solved to 2.5-A resolution as a partial
	complex with the cofactor NADP(+) and to 2. 1-A resolution as a fully
	bound 'holo' complex. The cofactor preference exhibited by different
	forms of the enzyme is predominantly determined by the electrostatic
	environment surrounding the 2'-hydroxy or the 2'-phosphate groups
	of the adenosine ribose moiety of NAD(+) or NADP(+), respectively.
	In the NADP(+)-dependent structures the presence of a threonine and
	a lysine contribute to the cofactor specificity. In the V. harveyi
	enzyme an arginine residue (Arg-210) contributes to the high cofactor
	affinity through a pi stacking interaction with the adenine ring
	system of the cofactor. Further differences between the V. harveyi
	enzyme and other aldehyde dehydrogenases are seen in the active site,
	in particular a histidine residue which is structurally conserved
	with phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This
	may suggest an alternative mechanism for activation of the reactive
	cysteine residue for nucleophilic attack.},

	Two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of solutions
	containing sucrose, HFCS, or various ratios of glucose to fructose
	(G:F) on food intake (FI), average appetite (AA), blood glucose (BG),
	plasma insulin, ghrelin, and uric acid (UA) in men. DESIGN: Sugar
	solutions (300 kcal/300 mL) were (in %) G20:F80, HFCS 55 (G45:F55),
	sucrose, and G80:F20 (experiment 1, n = 12) and G20:F80, G35:F65,
	G50:F50, sucrose, and G80:F20 (experiment 2, n = 19). The controls
	were a sweet energy-free control (experiment 1) and water (both experiments).
	Solutions were provided in a repeated-measures design. AA, BG, and
	FI were measured in all subjects. Hormonal responses and UA were
	measured in 7 subjects in experiment 2. Measurements were taken from
	baseline to 75 min. FI was measured at 80 min. RESULTS: Sucrose and
	HFCS (experiment 1) and sucrose and G50:F50 (experiment 2) had similar
	effects on all dependent measures. All sugar solutions similarly
	reduced the AA area under the curve (AUC). FI and plasma UA concentrations
	were significantly (P < 0.05) lower after high-glucose solutions
	than after low-glucose solutions. The lower FI was associated with
	a greater BG AUC (P < 0.05) and smaller AA and ghrelin AUCs (P <
	0.01). Insulin and BG AUCs were positively associated (P < 0.001).
	CONCLUSION: Sucrose, HFCS, and G50:F50 solutions do not differ significantly
	in their short-term effects on subjective and physiologic measures
	of satiety, UA, and FI at a subsequent meal.},

	We have constructed a synthetic AND gate in the bacterium Escherichia

	activates a promoter output only when both input promoters are transcriptionally
	active. The integration occurs via an interaction between an mRNA

	The second promoter controls the amber suppressor tRNA supD. When

	are promoters, the design is modular; that is, it can be reconnected
	to integrate different input signals and the output can be used to
	drive different cellular responses. We demonstrate this modularity
	by wiring the gate to integrate natural promoters (responding to
	Mg(2+) and AI-1) and using it to implement a phenotypic output (invasion

	modelling from a computer with web connection without the need of
	downloading and installing large program packages and databases.
	RESULTS: SWISS-MODEL workspace is a web-based integrated service
	dedicated to protein structure homology modelling. It assists and
	guides the user in building protein homology models at different
	levels of complexity. A personal working environment is provided
	for each user where several modelling projects can be carried out
	in parallel. Protein sequence and structure databases necessary for
	modelling are accessible from the workspace and are updated in regular
	intervals. Tools for template selection, model building and structure
	quality evaluation can be invoked from within the workspace. Workflow
	and usage of the workspace are illustrated by modelling human Cyclin

	The energies of the weak d-to-d transitions of the Co complexes are

	phases of 2.3 and 46 ?s. The greater separation and better fluorescence
	changes facilitated a detailed kinetic analysis for the ultrafast

	changed little with denaturant concentration or mutation but unfolding
	was very sensitive to denaturant and energy changes on mutation.
	The folding rate constant of 3 × 10(5) s(-1) in water decreased with
	increasing viscosity, and was extrapolated to 4.4 × 10(5) s(-1) at
	zero viscosity. Thus, the formation of the intermediate was partly

	give a very diffuse transition state, which was followed by the formation
	of structure. Conversely, the unfolding reaction required the near
	complete disruption of the tertiary structure of the intermediate
	in a highly cooperative manner, being exquisitely sensitive to individual
	mutations. The folding is approaching, but has not reached, the downhill-folding
	scenario of energy landscape theory. Under folding conditions, there
	is a small energy barrier between the denatured and transition states

	C production processes. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 2,5-DKG

	in the cofactor-binding pocket of 2,5-DKG reductase A in an attempt

	less expensive and more prevalent in the cell than is NADPH. To the
	best of our knowledge, this is the first focused attempt to alter
	the cofactor specificity of a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily
	by engineering improved activity with NADH into the enzyme. Activity
	of the mutants with NADH or NADPH was assayed using activity-stained

	an almost 7-fold improvement in catalysis with NADH compared with
	the wild-type enzyme. Surprisingly, most of this catalytic improvement
	appeared to be due to an improvement in the apparent kcat for the

	We have previously reported making a number of site-directed mutations

	In addition, several chimeric mutants have been produced that contain
	the same residues as are found in other members of the aldo-keto
	reductase superfamily that are naturally able to use NADH as a cofactor.
	The most active mutants obtained in this work were also combined

  abstract = {Human aldehyde reductase is a NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase
	that is closely related (65% identity) to aldose reductase, an enzyme
	involved in the pathogenesis of some diabetic and galactosemic complications.
	In aldose reductase, the active site residue Tyr48 is the proton
	donor in a hydrogen-bonding network involving residues Asp43/Lys77,
	while His110 directs the orientation of substrates in the active
	site pocket. Mutation of the homologous Tyr49 to phenylalamine or
	histidine (Y49F or Y49H) and of Lys79 to methionine (K79M) in aldehyde
	reductase yields inactive enzymes, indicating similar roles for these
	residues in the catalytic mechanism of aldehyde reductase. A H112Q
	mutant aldehyde reductase exhibited a substantial decrease in catalytic
	efficiency (kcat/Km) for hydrophilic (average 150-fold) and aromatic
	substrates (average 4200-fold) and 50-fold higher IC50 values for
	a variety of inhibitors than that of the wild-type enzyme. The data
	suggest that His112 plays a major role in determining the substrate
	specificity of aldehyde reductase, similar to that shown earlier
	for the homologous His110 in aldose reductase [Bohren, K. M., et.
	al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 2021-2032]. Mutation of Ile298 or Val299
	affected the kinetic parameters to a much lesser degree. Unlike native
	aldose reductase, which contains a thiol-sensitive Cys298, neither
	the I298C or V299C mutant exhibited any thiol sensitivity, suggesting
	a geometry of the active site pocket different from that in aldose
	reductase. Also different from aldose reductase, the detection of
	a significant primary deuterium isotope effect on kcat (1.48 +/-
	0.02) shows that nucleotide exchange is only partially rate-limiting.
	Primary substrate and solvent deuterium isotope effects on the H112Q
	mutant suggest that hydride and proton transfers occur in two discrete
	steps with hydride transfer taking place first. Dissociation constants
	and spectroscopic and fluorimetric properties of nucleotide complexes
	with various mutants suggest that, in addition to Tyr49 and His112,
	Lys79 plays a hitherto unappreciated role in nucleotide binding.
	The mode of inhibition of aldehyde reductase by aldose reductase
	inhibitors (ARIs) is generally similar to that of aldose reductase
	and involves binding to the E:NADP+ complex, as shown by kinetic
	and direct inhibitor-binding experiments. The order of ARI potency
	was AL1576 (Ki = 60 nM) > tolrestat > ponalrestat > sorbinil > FK366
	> zopolrestat > alrestatin (Ki = 148 microM). Our data on aldehyde
	reductase suggest that the active site pocket significantly differs
	from that of aldose reductase, possibly due to the participation
	of the C-terminal loop in its formation.},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Horizontal transfer (HT) could play an important role
	in the long-term persistence of transposable elements (TEs) because
	it provides them with the possibility to avoid the checking effects
	of host-silencing mechanisms and natural selection, which would eventually
	drive their elimination from the genome. However, despite the increasing
	evidence for HT of TEs, its rate of occurrence among the TE pools
	of model eukaryotic organisms is still unknown. RESULTS: We have
	extracted and compared the nucleotide sequences of all potentially
	functional autonomous TEs present in the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster,
	D. simulans and D. yakuba - 1,436 insertions classified into 141
	distinct families - and show that a large fraction of the families
	found in two or more species display levels of genetic divergence
	and within-species diversity that are significantly lower than expected
	by assuming copy-number equilibrium and vertical transmission, and
	consistent with a recent origin by HT. Long terminal repeat (LTR)
	retrotransposons form nearly 90% of the HT cases detected. HT footprints
	are also frequent among DNA transposons (40% of families compared)
	but rare among non-LTR retroelements (6%). Our results suggest a
	genomic rate of 0.04 HT events per family per million years between
	the three species studied, as well as significant variation between
	major classes of elements. CONCLUSIONS: The genome-wide patterns
	of sequence diversity of the active autonomous TEs in the genomes
	of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba suggest that one-third
	of the TE families originated by recent HT between these species.
	This result emphasizes the important role of horizontal transmission
	in the natural history of Drosophila TEs.}

	developed a pleuric effusion, which was treated by thoracentesis.

	are indicated only in selected cases, so that the "gold standard"
	treatment is still the laparotomic one, especially by a pseudocyst-jejunostomy,
	which also in our experience has given the best result. Very promising
	also, according to the latest data from the literature, seems the
	laparoscopic approach, by which a wide communication between the

	known structure in the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and
	may provide a paradigm for other mammalian HSDs in this family. The
	structure of the 3 alpha-HSD.NADP+ binary complex has been determined
	at 2.7 A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of
	23.4% with good geometry. The model is similar to other binary complexes
	in the AKR superfamily in that NADP+ binds at the C-terminal end
	of an alpha/beta barrel. However, it is unique in that NADP+ is bound
	in two alternate conformations, probably because of the lack of a
	salt-linked "safety belt" over the pyrophosphate bridge. The structure
	supports a previously proposed catalytic mechanism for carbonyl reduction
	in which Tyr 55 is the general acid, and its effective pKa is lowered
	by the adjacent Lys 84. We present evidence that the structurally
	distinct short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily may
	have convergently evolved a similar catalytic mechanism. Insight
	into substrate binding is offered by a crystal packing contact in
	which a neighboring molecule inserts a tryptophan residue (Trp 227)
	into an apolar cleft in 3 alpha-HSD. This cleft is proximal to the
	bound NADP+ cofactor and contains a surface of apolar residues (Leu
	54, Trp 86, Leu 122, Phe 128, Phe 129, Leu 137, Phe 139), making
	it a likely candidate for the substrate-binding site. Thus, in forming
	this crystal contact, Trp 227 may mimic a portion of a bound steroid.
	In addition, we propose that a water molecule in the active site
	indicates the position of the hydroxyl oxygen in a 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid
	substrate. Knowledge of the position of this water molecule, combined
	with the stereochemistry of hydride transfer, suggests that the alpha
	face of a bound steroid will be oriented toward the side of the apolar
	cleft containing Trp 86.},

	coefficients for any two good reaction coordinates that separate

	cancer can reduce breast cancer mortality. The use of a saliva-based
	test could prove to be very useful in post-operative and/or adjunctive

	study was undertaken to establish the possible usefulness of the
	salivary protein product of the oncogene c-erbB-2 in following patients
	diagnosed with carcinoma of the breast. Included in this study were
	25 patients with a mean age of 54 years with varying histological
	diagnoses and stages of carcinoma of the breast. ELISA assays for
	c-erbB-2 and CA 15-3 were performed on serum and stimulated whole
	saliva samples collected on all patients prior to any adjunct therapy
	or surgery and sequentially during therapy. RESULTS: The results
	of the GLM analyses using marker concentration as the dependent variable
	and treatment regimen and the serial assessments as independent variables
	yielded a significant overall model for both the serum (P < 0.007)
	and salivary (P < 0.017) c-erbB-2 markers. The model for serum c-erbB-2,
	however, exhibited a significant difference for treatment regimen
	(P < 0.001) with the chemotherapy and radiation treatment regimen
	being significantly different (P < 0.001) from the other treatment
	therapies. Time (serial assessments) was not significant. The model
	for the salivary c-erbB-2 marker was reversed. Treatment regimen
	was not significant for this model; however, time (serial assessments)
	was significant (P < 0.002). The serum and salivary CA 15-3 marker
	models yielded no significant results. Paired t-test analyses indicated
	that only the salivary c-erbB-2 concentrations exhibited a significant
	difference between the pre- and post-therapy values (t = 4.245, P
	< 0.0001). Additionally, salivary c-erbB-2 displayed greater percent
	reductions across all therapies as compared to the other markers.
	CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study appears to indicate that c-erbB-2
	protein expression in saliva may be a very useful diagnostic tool
	for measuring patient response to chemotherapy and/or surgical treatment
	of their disease.},

  abstract = {The active site of human aldose reductase contains two residues, His110
	and Tyr48, either of which could be the proton donor during catalysis.
	Tyr48 is a candidate since its hydroxyl group is in proximity to
	Lys77 and thus may have an abnormally low pKa value. To distinguish
	between these possibilities, we used site-directed mutagenesis to
	create the H110Q and H110A, the Y48F, Y48H, and Y48S, and the K77M
	mutant enzymes. The two His110 mutants resulted in a 1000-20,000-fold
	drop in kcat/Km, respectively, for the reduction of DL-glyceraldehyde
	at pH 7. The Y48F mutation caused total loss of activity, whereas
	the Y48H and Y48S mutants retained catalytic activity with kcat/Km
	reduced by 5 orders of magnitude. The K77M mutant is an inactive
	enzyme. Kinetic studies using xylose stereoisomers show that the
	wild-type enzyme distinguishes between D-xylose, L-xylose, and D-lyxose
	up to 150-fold better than the H110A or H110Q mutants. The His110
	mutants do not effectively discriminate between these isomers (4-11-fold).
	The crystal structure of the Y48H mutant refined at 1.8-A resolution
	shows that the overall structure is not significantly different from
	the wild-type structure. Electron densities for the histidine side
	chain and a new water molecule fill the space occupied by Tyr48 in
	the wild-type enzyme. The water molecule is in hydrogen-bonding distance
	to the N zeta group of Lys77 and to the N epsilon of His48 and fills
	the space occupied by the hydroxyl group of tyrosine in the wild-type
	structure. These findings suggest that proton transfer is mediated
	in the Y48H mutant enzyme by the water molecule. The Y48H mutant
	shows large and equal primary deuterium isotope effects on kcat and
	kcat/Km (1.81 +/- 0.03), providing direct evidence for hydride transfer
	as the rate-determining step in this mutant. Deuterium solvent isotope
	effects indicate that the relative contribution of proton transfer
	to this step of the catalytic cascade is much less important for
	the Y48H mutant than for the wild-type enzyme [D2O(kcat/Km) = 1.06
	+/- 0.02 and 4.73 +/- 0.23, respectively]. The kinetic and mutagenesis
	data, together with structural data, indicate that His 110 plays
	an important role in the orientation of substrates in the active
	site pocket, while Tyr48 is the proton donor during aldehyde reduction
	by aldose reductase.},

  abstract = {Although much of the motivation for experimental studies of protein
	folding is to obtain insights for improving protein structure prediction,
	there has been relatively little connection between experimental
	protein folding studies and computational structural prediction work
	in recent years. In the present study, we show that the relationship
	between protein folding rates and the contact order (CO) of the native
	structure has implications for ab initio protein structure prediction.
	Rosetta ab initio folding simulations produce a dearth of high CO
	structures and an excess of low CO structures, as expected if the
	computer simulations mimic to some extent the actual folding process.
	Consistent with this, the majority of failures in ab initio prediction
	in the CASP4 (critical assessment of structure prediction) experiment
	involved high CO structures likely to fold much more slowly than
	the lower CO structures for which reasonable predictions were made.
	This bias against high CO structures can be partially alleviated
	by performing large numbers of additional simulations, selecting
	out the higher CO structures, and eliminating the very low CO structures;
	this leads to a modest improvement in prediction quality. More significant
	improvements in predictions for proteins with complex topologies
	may be possible following significant increases in high-performance
	computing power, which will be required for thoroughly sampling high
	CO conformations (high CO proteins can take six orders of magnitude
	longer to fold than low CO proteins). Importantly for such a strategy,
	simulations performed for high CO structures converge much less strongly
	than those for low CO structures, and hence, lack of simulation convergence
	can indicate the need for improved sampling of high CO conformations.
	The parallels between Rosetta simulations and folding in vivo may
	extend to misfolding: The very low CO structures that accumulate
	in Rosetta simulations consist primarily of local up-down beta-sheets
	that may resemble precursors to amyloid formation.},

	have been genetically modified to increase their tolerance. Commercial
	glyphosate-based formulations most commonly range from concentrates
	containing 41% or more glyphosate to 1% glyphosate formulations marketed
	for domestic use. They generally consist of an aqueous mixture of
	the isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate, a surfactant, and various
	minor components including anti-foaming and colour agents, biocides
	and inorganic ions to produce pH adjustment. The mechanisms of toxicity

	used as five different salts but commercial formulations of it contain

	probably contribute to the acute toxicity of glyphosate formulations,
	the weight of evidence is against surfactants potentiating the toxicity
	of glyphosate.Accidental ingestion of glyphosate formulations is
	generally associated with only mild, transient, gastrointestinal
	features. Most reported cases have followed the deliberate ingestion
	of the concentrated formulation of Roundup (The use of trade names
	is for product identification purposes only and does not imply endorsement.)
	(41% glyphosate as the IPA salt and 15% POEA). There is a reasonable
	correlation between the amount ingested and the likelihood of serious
	systemic sequelae or death. Advancing age is also associated with
	a less favourable prognosis. Ingestion of >85 mL of the concentrated
	formulation is likely to cause significant toxicity in adults. Gastrointestinal
	corrosive effects, with mouth, throat and epigastric pain and dysphagia
	are common. Renal and hepatic impairment are also frequent and usually
	reflect reduced organ perfusion. Respiratory distress, impaired consciousness,
	pulmonary oedema, infiltration on chest x-ray, shock, arrythmias,
	renal failure requiring haemodialysis, metabolic acidosis and hyperkalaemia
	may supervene in severe cases. Bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmias
	are often present pre-terminally. Dermal exposure to ready-to-use
	glyphosate formulations can cause irritation and photo-contact dermatitis
	has been reported occasionally; these effects are probably due to
	the preservative Proxel (benzisothiazolin-3-one). Severe skin burns
	are very rare. Inhalation is a minor route of exposure but spray
	mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the
	mouth, tingling and throat irritation. Eye exposure may lead to mild
	conjunctivitis, and superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation
	is delayed or inadequate. Management is symptomatic and supportive,
	and skin decontamination with soap and water after removal of contaminated
	clothing should be undertaken in cases of dermal exposure.},

	this article, we investigate the relation between the intake of high-fructose
	corn syrup (HFCS) and the development of obesity. We analyzed food
	consumption patterns by using US Department of Agriculture food consumption
	tables from 1967 to 2000. The consumption of HFCS increased > 1000%
	between 1970 and 1990, far exceeding the changes in intake of any
	other food or food group. HFCS now represents > 40% of caloric sweeteners
	added to foods and beverages and is the sole caloric sweetener in
	soft drinks in the United States. Our most conservative estimate
	of the consumption of HFCS indicates a daily average of 132 kcal
	for all Americans aged > or = 2 y, and the top 20% of consumers of
	caloric sweeteners ingest 316 kcal from HFCS/d. The increased use
	of HFCS in the United States mirrors the rapid increase in obesity.
	The digestion, absorption, and metabolism of fructose differ from
	those of glucose. Hepatic metabolism of fructose favors de novo lipogenesis.
	In addition, unlike glucose, fructose does not stimulate insulin
	secretion or enhance leptin production. Because insulin and leptin
	act as key afferent signals in the regulation of food intake and
	body weight, this suggests that dietary fructose may contribute to
	increased energy intake and weight gain. Furthermore, calorically
	sweetened beverages may enhance caloric overconsumption. Thus, the
	increase in consumption of HFCS has a temporal relation to the epidemic
	of obesity, and the overconsumption of HFCS in calorically sweetened
	beverages may play a role in the epidemic of obesity.},

	and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed
	over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of
	biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic
	acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in
	solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such
	systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools
	that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free
	energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis
	techniques, and model-building capabilities. The CHARMM program is
	applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle
	systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number
	of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular
	mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions
	with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit
	solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous
	platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article
	provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis
	on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article

	degradations. The discrimination between NAD and NADP is therefore
	an impressive example of the power of molecular recognition by proteins.
	The many known tertiary structures of NADP complexes affords the
	possibility for an analysis of their discrimination. A systematic
	analysis of several crystal structures of NAD(P)-protein complexes

	their stereochemical similarity where the only difference is a phosphomonoester
	on the ribose near the adenine of NADP, they show different biochemical
	reactivities with NAD behaving as an oxidant and NADP as a reductant.
	NAD(P)-dependent enzymes generally share a common open alpha/beta
	fold with few exceptions only recently structurally characterized.
	This study of the molecular evolution of the NAD(P) binding domains,
	possible given the large number of known molecular structures, addresses
	two main questions: 1) can a common fold exist in different biological
	systems (divergent evolution) and 2) does a relationship exist among
	similar biological systems that display different folds (convergent
	evolution)? Both the structures of mono- and dinucleotide binding
	domains have been classified by cluster analysis based on the similarity
	evaluated by their main chain C alpha superposition. Moreover, the
	cofactor conformations and the stereochemical characteristics of
	their pockets have also been classified by analogous methods on the
	basis of the published tertiary structures. Two primary results appear:
	1) the classification of the mononucleotide binding domains is different
	from that of the dinucleotide binding folds and 2) both divergent
	and convergent evolutionary pathways can be hypothesized, the latter
	less frequently observed and less pronounced but nevertheless evident.
	The generally accepted hypothesis that dinucleotide binding domains
	have evolved by gene duplication of primordial genes coding for the
	smaller mononucleotide binding domains is acceptable but the two
	halves of the resulting dinucleotide binding domains are evolutionarily
	uncorrelated. The NH2-terminal mononucleotide binding domain is less
	variable than the COOH-terminal half, probably because it involves
	the binding of the ADP moiety of NAD(P) invariant in all examined
	systems. There is evidence to postulate that evolutionary pathways
	for NAD(P)-dependent enzymes are both divergent and convergent. In
	fact, nearly all combinations of similarity dissimilarity in overall
	fold, cofactor conformation, and cofactor binding pocket structural
	characteristics for each enzyme pair examined are possible. The NAD(P)-dependent

	Thirty-six patients aged 42-63 years (mean age 55 years) with a single
	breast lesion previously detected at standard mammography were studied.
	All US examinations were performed using an ATL HDI 5000 ultrasound
	device with a 5-10 MHz linear-array transducer, before and after
	administration of ultrasound contrast medium Levovist (Schering(R),
	Berlin) was administered by bolus injection (2 ml/s) via a 20 G catheter
	probe. The mechanical index was set to high to obtain instant rupture
	of the microbubbles under insonation. Intensity/time curves of the
	transient scattering in the region of interest (ROI) after contrast
	administration were extrapolated. The areas under the ROI curves
	were also evaluated to quantitatively assess the scattering. RESULTS:
	The US baseline study and colour Doppler US identified 19 benign
	lesions (15 histologically proven) and 17 malignant lesions (16 histologically
	proven). The administration of contrast medium did not improve the
	specificity of the examination. Only by plotting the intensity/time
	curves of the regions of interest (ROI) and evaluating the areas
	under the ROI curves, was a significant correlation detected between
	US and histopathologic diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although further evaluation
	on a larger series is needed, the analysis of breast lesions by contrast-enhanced
	perfusion US seems to be a promising technique. Perfusion US can
	usefully complement high-frequency US, especially when mammography

  abstract = {Covalent modification can expand a protein's functional capacity.
	Fluorescent or radioactive labeling, for instance, allows imaging
	of a protein in real time. Labeling with an affinity probe enables
	isolation of target proteins and other interacting molecules. At
	the other end of this functional spectrum, protein structures can
	be naturally altered by enzymatic action. Protein-protein interactions,
	genetic regulation, and a range of cellular processes are under the
	purview of these post-translational modifications. The ability of
	protein chemists to install these covalent additions selectively
	has been critical for elucidating their roles in biology. Frequently
	the transformations must be applied in a site-specific manner, which
	demands the most selective chemistry. In this Account, we discuss
	the development and application of such chemistry in our laboratory.
	A centerpiece of our strategy is a "tag-and-modify" approach, which
	entails sequential installation of a uniquely reactive chemical group
	into the protein (the "tag") and the selective or specific modification
	of this group. The chemical tag can be a natural or unnatural amino
	acid residue. Of the natural residues, cysteine is the most widely
	used as a tag. Early work in our program focused on selective disulfide
	formation in the synthesis of glycoproteins. For certain applications,
	the susceptibility of disulfides to reduction was a limitation and
	prompted the development of several methods for the synthesis of
	more stable thioether modifications. The desulfurization of disulfides
	and conjugate addition to dehydroalanine are two routes to these
	modifications. The dehydroalanine tag has since proven useful as
	a general precursor to many modifications after conjugate addition
	of various nucleophiles; phosphorylated, glycosylated, peptidylated,
	prenylated, and even mimics of methylated and acetylated lysine-containing
	proteins are all accessible from dehydroalanine. While cysteine is
	a useful tag for selective modification, unnatural residues present
	the opportunity for bio-orthogonal chemistry. Azide-, arylhalide-,
	alkyne-, and alkene-containing amino acids can be incorporated into
	proteins genetically and can be specifically modified through various
	transformations. These transformations often rely on metal catalysis.
	The Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne addition, Ru-catalyzed olefin metathesis,
	and Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling are examples of such transformations.
	In the course of adapting these reactions to protein modification,
	we learned much about the behavior of these reactions in water, and
	in some cases entirely new catalysts were developed. Through a combination
	of these bio-orthogonal transformations from the panel of tag-and-modify
	reactions, multiple and distinct modifications can be installed on
	protein surfaces. Multiple modifications are common in natural systems,
	and synthetic access to these proteins has enabled study of their
	biological role. Throughout these investigations, much has been learned
	in chemistry and biology. The demands of selective protein modification
	have revealed many aspects of reaction mechanisms, which in turn
	have guided the design of reagents and catalysts that allow their
	successful deployment in water and in biological milieu. With this
	ability to modify proteins, it is now possible to interrogate biological
	systems with precision that was not previously possible.},

	As demonstrated in a recent CASPR experiment, improvement can be
	quite reliably achieved when the initial models are sufficiently
	close to the native basin (e.g., 3-4 A C(alpha) RMSD). A key element
	to effective refinement is to incorporate reliable structural information
	into the simulation protocol. Without intimate knowledge of the target
	and prediction protocol used to generate the initial structural models,
	it can be assumed that the regular secondary structure elements (helices
	and strands) and overall fold topology are largely correct to start
	with, such that the protocol limits itself to the scope of refinement
	and focuses the sampling in vicinity of the initial structure. The
	secondary structures can be enforced by dihedral restraints and the
	topology through structural contacts, implemented as either multiple
	pair-wise C(alpha) distance restraints or a single sidechain distance
	matrix restraint. The restraints are weakly imposed with flat-bottom
	potentials to allow sufficient flexibility for structural rearrangement.
	Refinement is further facilitated by enhanced sampling of advanced
	techniques such as the replica exchange method (REX). In general,
	for single domain proteins of small to medium sizes, 3-5 nanoseconds
	of REX/GB refinement simulations appear to be sufficient for reasonable
	convergence. Clustering of the resulting structural ensembles can
	yield refined models over 1.0 A closer to the native structure in
	C(alpha) RMSD. Substantial improvement of sidechain contacts and
	rotamer states can also be achieved in most cases. Additional improvement
	is possible with longer sampling and knowledge of the robust structural
	features in the initial models for a given prediction protocol. Nevertheless,

	approach to create hERalpha variants with enhanced androgen specificity

	of ER ligand specificity and the evolutionary mechanism of nuclear
	receptors. We developed a sensitive yeast two-hybrid system to screen
	for hERalpha variants with increased transactivation potency toward
	testosterone. After two rounds of directed evolution, we identified
	five hERalpha variants with dramatically improved transactivation
	potency toward testosterone in both yeast and mammalian cells. These

	for testosterone and only slightly reduced affinity toward 17beta-estradiol.
	Detailed analysis of these evolved variants and a few site-directed
	mutants generated de novo led to several unexpected findings including
	the following. 1) Only two beneficial mutations were needed to create
	hERalpha variants with near nanomolar affinity for testosterone.
	2) Some beneficial mutations were synergistic, context-dependent,
	or non-additive. 3) Of the five identified beneficial mutations,
	four of them were not in the ER ligand binding pocket and yet exerted
	important action on ligand specificity. 4) The single ligand-contacting
	mutation E353Q plays a dominant role in discriminating androgens
	and estrogens. These results, viewed in conjunction with the ligand
	exploitation model of nuclear receptor evolution, suggest that the
	mutation E353Q may represent a key event in the evolution of androgen
	receptors from an ancestral estrogen receptor and that ligand promiscuity
	may play an important role in the creation of new nuclear receptors
	via divergent evolution.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli strain PC09 (DeltaxylB, cAMP-independent CRP (crp*)
	mutant) expressing an NADPH-dependent xylose reductase from Candida
	boidinii (CbXR) was previously reported to produce xylitol from xylose
	while metabolizing glucose [Cirino et al. (2006) Biotechnol Bioeng
	95(6): 1167-1176]. This study aims to understand the role of NADPH
	supply in xylitol yield and the contribution of key central carbon
	metabolism enzymes toward xylitol production. Studies in which the
	expression of CbXR or a xylose transporter was increased suggest
	that enzyme activity and xylose transport are not limiting xylitol
	production in PC09. A constraints-based stoichiometric metabolic
	network model was used to understand the roles of central carbon
	metabolism reactions and xylose transport energetics on the theoretical
	maximum molar xylitol yield (xylitol produced per glucose consumed),
	and xylitol yields (Y(RPG)) were measured from resting cell biotransformations
	with various PC09 derivative strains. For the case of xylose-proton
	symport, omitting the Zwf (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) or
	PntAB (membrane-bound transhydrogenase) reactions or TCA cycle activity
	from the model reduces the theoretical maximum yield from 9.2 to
	8.8, 3.6, and 8.0 mol xylitol (mol glucose)(-1), respectively. Experimentally,
	deleting pgi (encoding phosphoglucose isomerase) from strain PC09
	improves the yield from 3.4 to 4.0 mol xylitol (mol glucose)(-1),
	while deleting either or both E. coli transhydrogenases (sthA and
	pntA) has no significant effect on the measured yield. Deleting either
	zwf or sucC (TCA cycle) significantly reduces the yield from 3.4
	to 2.0 and 2.3 mol xylitol (mol glucose)(-1), respectively. Expression
	of a xylose reductase with relaxed cofactor specificity increases
	the yield to 4.0. The large discrepancy between theoretical maximum
	and experimentally determined yield values suggests that biocatalysis
	is compromised by pathways competing for reducing equivalents and
	dissipating energy. The metabolic role of transhydrogenases during
	E. coli biocatalysis has remained largely unspecified. Our results
	demonstrate the importance of direct NADPH supply by NADP+-utilizing
	enzymes in central metabolism for driving heterologous NADPH-dependent
	reactions, and suggest that the pool of reduced cofactors available
	for biotransformation is not readily interchangeable via transhydrogenase.},

	of packing of the hydrophobic core and some additional features,
	such as cross-helical H bonds. Comparison of the x-ray structures
	indicates that the nL substitution produces only local perturbations.
	Consequently, the finding that the small stabilization by the mutation

	structures relative to the distribution of the energies of these
	random structures (the Z-score). Different methods have been described

	Here, we demonstrate a new approach. Results: For a single protein
	sequence, the probability of success (i.e. the probability that the
	folded state is the lowest energy state) is derived. We then maximize
	the average probability of success for a set of proteins to obtain
	the optimal potential energy function. This results in maximum attention
	being focused on the proteins whose structures are difficult but
	not impossible to predict. Conclusions: Using a lattice model of
	proteins, we show that the optimal interaction potentials obtained
	by our method are both more accurate and more likely to produce successful

	Rosetta de novo protocol, which allows the full length of the domain
	to explore conformational space via fragment-insertion, producing

	The enzyme utilizes NAD(+) specifically as a coenzyme. Potential

	that three more residues in 15-PGDH, Ile-17, Asn-91, and Val-186,

	method was not working on the Mg and Pd/Mg system. Pd/Fe and Pd/Zn
	gave the highest reaction rate for 2,4,6-TCP dechlorination, producing

	the accuracy of predictions in the comparative modeling category
	is often worse than that of the template on which the homology model
	is based. Here we describe a refinement protocol that is able to
	consistently refine submitted predictions for all categories at CASP7.
	The protocol uses direct energy minimization of the knowledge-based
	potential of mean force that is based on the interaction statistics
	of 167 atom types (Summa and Levitt, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2007;
	104:3177-3182). Our protocol is thus computationally very efficient;
	it only takes a few minutes of CPU time to run typical protein models
	(300 residues). We observe an average structural improvement of 1\%
	in GDT_TS, for predictions that have low and medium homology to known
	PDB structures (Global Distance Test score or GDT_TS between 50 and
	80\%). We also observe a marked improvement in the stereochemistry
	of the models. The level of improvement varies amongst the various
	participants at CASP, but we see large improvements (>10\% increase
	in GDT_TS) even for models predicted by the best performing groups
	at CASP7. In addition, our protocol consistently improved the best
	predicted models in the refinement category at CASP7 and CASP8. These
	improvements in structure and stereochemistry prove the usefulness

	receptor proteolytically activated by trypsin, tryptase or factor
	Xa. Alternatively, PAR2 can be activated by synthetic peptides whose
	sequence mimics the tethered ligand exposed after receptor cleavage.
	It is known that PAR2 modulates vascular reactivity, both in vitro
	and in vivo. The present study was designed to investigate the role
	of basal nitric oxide and cyclic nucleotides, adenosine 3'5'cyclic
	monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine 3'5' cyclic monophosphate (cGMP),
	in the vasorelaxation induced by a PAR2-activating peptide (PAR2-AP;
	SLIGRL-NH(2)) on rat aorta in vitro. METHODS: A concentration-response
	curve to PAR2-AP was performed on rat thoracic aorta with or without
	a functional endothelium, and the effect of inhibitors was evaluated.
	The effect of PAR2-AP (10(-7)-3 x 10(-5) M) on endothelium-denuded
	aorta was also evaluated after tissue incubation with sodium nitroprusside.
	RESULTS: PAR2-AP (10(-7)-3 x 10(-5) M) caused an endothelium-dependent
	relaxation abolished by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, L-NAME,
	and by the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3-a]
	quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), but unaffected by geldanamycin. Vasorelaxant
	effect of PAR2-AP was only partially inhibited by the adenylyl cyclase
	inhibitor, 9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine (SQ 22,536),
	and it was increased by tissue incubation with the phosphodiesterase
	inhibitor, rolipram. On tissue without endothelium, PAR2-AP did not
	cause vasorelaxation, up to a concentration of 10(-4) M. However,
	after tissue incubation with sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 3 x 10(-9)
	M), the vasorelaxant effect of PAR2-AP was restored. Following tissue
	incubation with PAR2-AP, cAMP levels were significantly increased
	compared to control values. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that
	vasorelaxation induced by PAR2-AP is modulated by basal nitric oxide
	with an involvement of both cyclic nucleotides, cGMP and cAMP.},

	The charges for the deoxyribose nucleosides and nucleotides are derived

	(RESP) fits,1,2 with Lagrangian multipliers ensuring a net charge
	of 0 or Â± 1. We suggest that the preferred approach for deriving
	charges for nucleosides and nucleotides involves allowing only C1?
	and H1? of the sugar to vary as the nucleic acid base, with the remainder
	of sugar and backbone atoms forced to be equivalent. For peptide

	employed by Williams3 and Reynolds et al.,4 with the RESP approach1,2

	the 20 naturally occuring amino acids. Based on our results for propyl

	to give charges that represent well the conformationally dependent
	electrostatic properties of molecules, provided that these two conformations
	contain different values of the dihedral angles that terminate in
	heteroatoms or hydrogens attached to heteroatoms. In these blocked
	dipeptide models, it is useful to require equivalent Nâ€”H and C?O
	charges for all amino acids with a given net charge (except proline),
	and this is accomplished in a straightforward fashion with multiple-molecule
	fitting. Finally, the application of multiple Lagrangian constraints
	allows for the derivation of monomeric residues with the appropriate
	net charge from a chemically blocked version of the residue. The
	multiple Lagrange constraints also enable charges from two or more
	molecules to be spliced together in a well-defined fashion. Thus,
	the combined use of multiple molecules, multiple conformations, multiple
	Lagrangian constraints, and RESP fitting is shown to be a powerful
	approach to deriving electrostatic charges for biopolymers. Â© 1995

	no increase in the stability of the P450 under standard reaction
	conditions (in 10 mM hydrogen peroxide), complete substitution with
	norleucine resulted in nearly two-fold-increased peroxygenase activity.
	Thermostability was significantly reduced. The fact that the enzyme
	can tolerate such extensive amino acid replacement suggests that
	we can engineer enzymes with unique chemical properties via incorporation
	of unnatural amino acids while retaining or improving catalytic properties.

	triple mutation leads to a switch in favor of NADP specificity but
	with a kcat/KM ratio 50- and 80-fold less than that observed for
	the wild type with NAD and for the chloroplast GAPDH with NADP, respectively.

	against a large library of alignments, removing positions predicted
	as unreliable. Near-optimal alignment information was the best predictor,
	removing 70% of the substantially-misaligned positions and 58% of
	the over-aligned positions, while retaining 86% of those aligned

	of three-dimensional protein structures on the basis of short interproton
	distances (less than 4 A) that can be realistically determined from
	nuclear magnetic resonance measurements in solution is assessed.
	The model system used is the 1.2 A resolution crystal structure of
	the 46 residue protein crambin, from which a set of 240 approximate
	distance restraints, divided into three ranges (2.5 +/- 0.5, 3.0+0.5(-1.0)
	and 4 +/- 1 A), is derived. This interproton distance set comprises
	159 short-range ([i-j] less than or equal to 5) and 56 ([i-j] greater
	than 5) long-range inter-residue distances and 25 intra-residue distances.
	Restrained molecular dynamics are carried out using a number of different
	protocols starting from two initial structures: a completely extended
	beta-strand; and an extended structure with two alpha-helices in
	the same positions as in the crystal structure (residues 7 to 19,
	and 23 to 30) and all other residues in the form of extended beta-strands.
	The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) atomic differences between these two
	initial structures and the crystal structure are 43 A and 23 A, respectively.
	It is shown that, provided protocols are used that permit the secondary
	structure elements to form at least partially prior to folding into
	a tertiary structure, convergence to the correct final structure,
	both globally and locally, is achieved. The r.m.s. atomic differences
	between the converged restrained dynamics structures and the crystal
	structure range from 1.5 to 2.2 A for the backbone atoms and from
	2.0 to 2.8 A for all atoms. The r.m.s. atomic difference between
	the X-ray structure and the structure obtained by first averaging
	the co-ordinates of the converged restrained dynamics structures
	is even smaller: 1.0 A for the backbone atoms and 1.6 A for all atoms.
	These results provide a measure with which to judge future experimental
	results on proteins whose crystal structures are unknown. In addition,
	from an examination of the dynamics trajectories, it is shown that
	the convergence pathways followed by the various simulations are
	different.},

  abstract = {DNA shuffling is a powerful process for directed evolution, which
	generates diversity by recombination(1,2), combining useful mutations
	from individual genes. Libraries of chimaeric genes can be generated
	by random frag;mentation of a pool of related genes, followed by
	reassembly of the fragments in a self-priming polymerase reaction.
	Template switching causes crossovers in areas of sequence homology.
	Our previous studies used single genes and random point mutations
	as the source of diversity(3-6). An alternative source of diversity
	is naturally occurring homologous genes, which provide 'functional
	diversity.' To evaluate whether natural diversity could accelerate
	the evolution process, we compared the efficiency of obtaining moxalactamase
	activity from four cephalosporinase genes evolved separately with
	that from a mixed pool of the four genes. A single cycle of shuffling
	yielded eightfold improvements from the four separately evolved genes,
	versus a 270- to 540-fold improvement from the four genes shuffled
	together, a 50-fold increase per cycle of shuffling. The best clone
	contained eight segments from three of the four genes as well as
	33 amino-acid point mutations, Molecular breeding by shuffling can
	efficiently mix sequences from different species, unlike traditional
	breeding techniques, The power of family shuffling may arise from
	sparse sampling of a larger portion of sequence space.},

  abstract = {We have developed and experimentally tested a novel computational
	approach for the de novo design of hydrophobic cores. A pair of computer
	programs has been written, the first of which creates a "custom"
	rotamer library for potential hydrophobic residues, based on the
	backbone structure of the protein of interest. The second program
	uses a genetic algorithm to globally optimize for a low energy core
	sequence and structure, using the custom rotamer library as input.
	Success of the programs in predicting the sequences of native proteins
	indicates that they should be effective tools for protein design.
	Using these programs, we have designed and engineered several variants
	of the phage 434 cro protein, containing five, seven, or eight sequence
	changes in the hydrophobic core. As controls, we have produced a
	variant consisting of a randomly generated core with six sequence
	changes but equal volume relative to the native core and a variant
	with a "minimalist" core containing predominantly leucine residues.
	Two of the designs, including one with eight core sequence changes,
	have thermal stabilities comparable to the native protein, whereas
	the third design and the minimalist protein are significantly destabilized.
	The randomly designed control is completely unfolded under equivalent
	conditions. These results suggest that rational de novo design of
	hydrophobic cores is feasible, and stress the importance of specific
	packing interactions for the stability of proteins. A surprising
	aspect of the results is that all of the variants display highly
	cooperative thermal denaturation curves and reasonably dispersed
	NMR spectra. This suggests that the non-core residues of a protein
	play a significant role in determining the uniqueness of the folded
	structure.},

  abstract = {This study suggests a molecular mechanism that explains the accumulation
	of denaturated proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of beta-cells.
	Such states were frequently observed in beta-cells experiencing increased
	demand for insulin production and were shown to lead to secretory
	dysfunction and diabetes. Here, a self-consistent kinetic model is
	used to investigate changes in protein translation due to ER overloading.
	The model is based on a molecular theory that relates the molecular
	composition and level of molecular crowding in the ER to the kinetic
	rates of protein folding/misfolding and transit to the Golgi apparatus
	(GA). This study suggests that molecular crowding forces can increase
	protein misfolding and impair the transport to the GA, thus overwhelming
	the quality control mechanism in the ER. A continual accumulation
	of toxic residues in the ER enhances even further the molecular crowding,
	accelerating protein denaturation. This article shows that molecular
	crowding affects differently the transit of various proteins through
	the ER. Apparently, the molecular crowding level that can inhibit
	the transport of native proinsulin to the GA influences to a lesser
	extent the transit of proamylin, a much smaller peptide cosynthesized
	with proinsulin in the ER. Smaller-volume misfolded proinsulin species
	may also win the passage competition through the ER and move on the
	secretory track. However, misfolded proinsulin fails the conversion
	to active insulin. This study can help us to decipher circumstances
	leading to the alteration of the secretory function in susceptible
	beta-cells and the onset of diabetes.},

	PGK as a function of crowding experimentally. We uncover a nonmonotonic
	folding relaxation time vs. Ficoll concentration. Theory and modeling

	Below the optimum, folding slows down because the unfolded state
	is stabilized relative to the transition state. Above the optimum,

	targeted post-translational modifications present in highly modified
	proteins using mixed integer linear optimization and electron transfer
	dissociation (ETD) tandem mass spectrometry. For a given ETD tandem
	mass spectrum, the rigorous set of modified forms that satisfy the
	mass of the precursor ion, within some tolerance error, are enumerated
	by solving a feasibility problem via mixed integer linear optimization.
	The enumeration of the entire superset of modified forms enables
	the method to normalize the relative contributions of the individual
	modification sites. Given the entire set of modified forms, a superposition
	problem is then formulated using mixed integer linear optimization
	to determine the relative fractions of the modified forms that are
	present in the multiplexed ETD tandem mass spectrum. Chromatographic
	information in the mass and time dimension is utilized to assess
	the likelihood of the assigned modification states, to average several
	tandem mass spectra for confident identification of lower level forms,
	and to infer modification states of partially assigned spectra. The
	utility of the proposed computational framework is demonstrated on
	an entire LC-MS/MS ETD experiment corresponding to a mixture of highly
	modified histone peptides. This new computational method will facilitate
	the unprecedented LC-MS/MS ETD analysis of many hypermodified proteins
	and offer novel biological insight into these previously understudied

	relevance of temperature initiated unfolding studies to the folding
	problem, we compare the folding and unfolding of a 125-residue protein
	model by Monte Carlo dynamics at two temperatures; the lower one
	corresponds to the range used in T -jump experiments and the higher
	one to the range used in unfolding simulations of all-atom models.
	The trajectories that lead from the native state to the denatured
	state at these elevated temperatures are less diverse than those
	observed in the folding simulations. At the lower temperature, the
	system unfolds through a mandatory intermediate that corresponds
	to a local free energy minimum. At the higher temperature, no such
	intermediate is observed, but a similar pathway is followed. The
	structures contributing to the unfolding pathways resemble most closely
	those that make up the "fast track" of folding. The transition state
	for unfolding at the lower temperature (above Tm) is determined and

	loops in the polypeptide chain, places one physical limit on the
	speed of protein folding. Many experimental studies have explored
	the kinetics of formation of end-to-end loops in polypeptide chains;
	however, protein folding more often requires the formation of contacts
	between interior points on the chain. One expects that, for loops
	of fixed contour length, interior loops will form more slowly than
	end-to-end loops, owing to the additional excluded volume associated
	with the "tails". We estimate the magnitude of this effect by generating
	ensembles of randomly coiled, freely jointed chains, and then using
	the theory of Szabo, Schulten, and Schulten to calculate the corresponding
	contact formation rates for these ensembles. Adding just a few residues,
	to convert an end-to-end loop to an internal loop, sharply decreases
	the contact rate. Surprisingly, the relative change in rate increases
	for a longer loop; sufficiently long tails, however, actually reverse
	the effect and accelerate loop formation slightly. Our results show
	that excluded volume effects in real, full-length polypeptides may
	cause the rates of loop formation during folding to depart significantly
	from the values derived from recent loop-formation experiments on
	short peptides.},

	have constructed a synthetic bacterial signal transduction pathway

	this system a computationally designed Zn2+-binding periplasmic receptor
	senses the extracellular solute and triggers a two-component signal
	transduction pathway via a chimeric transmembrane protein, resulting
	in transcriptional up-regulation of a beta-galactosidase reporter
	gene. The Zn2+-binding site in the designed receptor is based on
	a four-coordinate, tetrahedral primary coordination sphere consisting
	of histidines and glutamates. In addition, mutations were introduced
	in a secondary coordination sphere to satisfy the residual hydrogen-bonding
	potential of the histidines coordinated to the metal. The importance
	of the secondary shell interactions is demonstrated by their effect
	on metal affinity and selectivity, as well as protein stability.
	Three designed protein sequences, comprising two distinct metal-binding
	positions, were all shown to bind Zn2+ and to function in the cell-based

	Amylolytic activity on soluble starch was optimal at pH 5.5-6.0 and

	share a conserved FAD-binding domain but lack a recognizable fold
	for binding the pyridine nucleotide. We have switched the coenzyme
	specificity of strictly NADPH-dependent PHBH from Pseudomonas fluorescens
	by site-directed mutagenesis. To that end, we altered the solvent
	exposed helix H2 region (residues 33-40) of the FAD-binding domain.
	Non-conservative selective replacements of Arg33 and Tyr38 weakened
	the binding of NADPH without disturbing the protein architecture.
	Introduction of a basic residue at position 34 increased the NADPH
	binding strength. Double (M2) and quadruple (M4) substitutions in
	the N-terminal part of helix H2 did not change the coenzyme specificity.
	By extending the replacements towards residues 38 and 40, M5 and

	of an acidic group at position 38 potentially enables the recognition

	kinase, lies a 1,101-bp open reading frame that exhibits 61% amino
	acid sequence identity to the Escherichia coli D-xylose binding periplasmic
	receptor, XylF, a component of the high-affinity binding-protein-dependent
	D-xylose transport. The 25-residue N-terminal fragment of the deduced
	T. ethanolicus XylF has typical features of bacterial leader peptides.
	The C-terminal portion of this leader sequence matches the cleavage
	consensus for lipoproteins and is followed by a 22-residue putative
	linker sequence rich in serine, threonine, and asparagine. The putative
	mature 341-amino-acid-residue XylF (calculated molecular mass of
	37,069 Da) appears to be a lipoprotein attached to the cell membrane
	via a lipid anchor covalently linked to the N-terminal cysteine,
	as demonstrated by metabolic labelling of the recombinant XylF with
	[14C]palmitate. The induced E. coli avidly bound D-[14C]xylose, yielding
	additional evidence that T. ethanolicus XylF is the D-xylose-binding
	protein. On the basis of sequence comparison of XylFs to other monosaccharide-binding
	proteins, we propose that the sequence signature of binding proteins
	specific for hexoses and pentoses be refined as (KDQ)(LIVFAG)3IX3(DN)(SGP)X3(GS)X(LIVA)
	2X2A. Transcription of the monocistronic 1.3-kb xylF mRNA is inducible
	by xylose and unaffected by glucose. Primer extension analysis indicated
	that xylF transcription initiates from two +1 sites, both situated
	within the xylAB operon. Unlike in similar transport systems in other
	bacteria, the genes specifying the membrane components (e.g., ATP-binding
	protein and permease) of the high-affinity D-xylose uptake system

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) participate as second messengers in
	the mitogenic signal transduction. Most of the experimental data
	supporting the role of ROS as signaling molecules have been obtained
	by using H2O2. Exposure of cells to H2O2 rapidly increases tyrosine
	phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) in the absence
	of growth factor binding, thus inducing the activation of downstream
	signaling cascades, like that of protein kinase B (AKT). Another
	molecule able to induce an increase of intracellular ROS levels is
	diethylmaleate (DEM), which acts by depleting the ROS scavenger reduced
	glutathione (GSH). A comparison of the effects exerted by H2O2 and
	DEM shows that the latter induces redox modifications milder than
	those generated by H2O2. We also demonstrated that DEM-induced redox
	modifications are not accompanied by platelet-derived growth factor-receptor
	(PDGF-R) and epidermal growth factor-receptor Tyr phosphorylation,
	although they are able to activate ERKs and AKT, with kinetics different
	from those observed following H2O2 treatment. The activation of these
	two pathways is not blocked by AG1296, a selective inhibitor of PDGF-R
	Tyr kinase, thus confirming that the effects of DEM are not mediated
	by the TKR phosphorylation. On the contrary, PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazole[3,4-d]pyrimidine),
	an inhibitor of Src kinase, completely prevents DEM- and H2O2-induced
	AKT activation but has no effect on the pathway of ERKs. Finally,
	nitration of Tyr residues in PDGF-R is observed in DEM-treated cells,
	thus suggesting that ROS-induced modifications different from Tyr
	phosphorylation can occur at the growth factor-receptor level and
	can be involved in the regulation of signaling pathways.},

  abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are membrane-anchored
	heterodimers that present antigenic peptides to T cells. Expression
	of these molecules in soluble form has met limited success, presumably
	due to their large size, heterodimeric structure and the presence
	of multiple disulfide bonds. Here we have used directed evolution
	and yeast surface display to engineer soluble single-chain human
	lymphocyte antigen (HLA) class II MHC DR1 molecules without covalently
	attached peptides (scDR1alphabeta). Specifically, a library of mutant
	scDR1alphabeta molecules was generated by random mutagenesis and
	screened by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) with DR-specific
	conformation-sensitive antibodies, yielding three well-expressed
	and properly folded scDR1alphabeta variants displayed on the yeast
	cell surface. Detailed analysis of these evolved variants and a few
	site-directed mutants generated de novo indicated three amino acid
	residues in the beta1 domain are important for the improved protein
	folding yield. Further, molecular modeling studies suggested these
	mutations might increase the protein folding efficiency by improving
	the packing of a hydrophobic core in the alpha1beta1 domain of DR1.
	The scDR1alphabeta mutants displayed on the yeast cell surface are
	remarkably stable and bind specifically to DR-specific peptide HA(306-318)
	with high sensitivity and rapid kinetics in flow cytometric assays.
	Moreover, since the expression, stability and peptide-binding properties
	of these mutants can be directly assayed on the yeast cell surface
	using immuno-fluorescence labeling and flow cytometry, time-consuming
	purification and refolding steps of recombinant DR1 molecules are
	eliminated. Therefore, these scDR1alphabeta molecules will provide
	a powerful technology platform for further design of DR1 molecules
	with improved peptide-binding specificity and affinity for therapeutic
	and diagnostic applications. The methods described here should be
	generally applicable to other class II MHC molecules and also class
	I MHC molecules for their functional expression, characterization
	and engineering.},

	information regarding post-translational modifications (PTMs). The
	Swiss-Prot knowledge base is faced with the challenge of including
	this information in a consistent and structured way, in order to
	facilitate easy retrieval and promote understanding by biologist
	expert users as well as computer programs. We are therefore standardizing
	the annotation of PTM features represented in Swiss-Prot. Indeed,
	a controlled vocabulary has been associated with every described
	PTM. In this paper, we present the major update of the feature annotation,
	and, by showing a few examples, explain how the annotation is implemented
	and what it means. Mod-Prot, a future companion database of Swiss-Prot,
	devoted to the biological aspects of PTMs (i.e., general description
	of the process, identity of the modification enzyme(s), taxonomic
	range, mass modification) is briefly described. Finally we encourage
	once again the scientific community (i.e., both individual researchers
	and database maintainers) to interact with us, so that we can continuously
	enhance the quality and swiftness of our services.},

	P450 propane monooxygenase (P450PMO) having 20 heme domain substitutions

	contrast, refinement of the enzyme catalytic efficiency for propane
	oxidation (approximately 9000-fold increase in kcat/Km) involves
	profound reshaping and partitioning of the substrate access pathway.
	Remodeling of the substrate-recognition mechanisms ultimately results
	in remarkable narrowing of the substrate profile around propane and

	E(2) (PGE(2)) to 15-epi-lipoxin A(4) (15-epi-LXA(4) or aspirin-triggered
	lipoxin, ATL). ATL formation by activated leukocytes (PMN) requires
	the intervention of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), an enzyme that is involved
	in leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) formation. (2) In the present study,
	we have examined the role of acetylated COX-2 and 5-LOX in modulating
	antiadhesive effects of aspirin on adhesion of PMN to endotoxin (LPS)-primed
	human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC). (3) Treating PMN/HUVEC
	cocultures with aspirin resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition
	of cell-to-cell adhesion induced by LPS. Treating HUVEC with selective
	COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib, caused an approximately
	70% reversion of antiadhesive effect of aspirin. In contrast, inhibition
	of neutrophil's 5-LOX pathway with 1 micro M ZD2138, a selective
	5-LOX inhibitor, 1 micro M BAY-X-1005, a FLAP inhibitor, or 100 micro
	M licofelone, a dual COX/5-LOX inhibitor, did not affect antiadhesive
	properties of aspirin. (4) Exposure to celecoxib (100 micro M) or
	rofecoxib (10 micro M) completely suppressed ATL formation caused
	by aspirin without affecting LTB(4) levels. ZD2138, licofelone and
	BAY-X-1005 inhibited ATL formation as well as LTB(4) generation.
	(5) Treatment with LXA(4) reduced PMN adhesion to HUVEC and counteracted
	the proadhesive effect of celecoxib. In contrast, exposure to Boc-1,
	an LXA(4) antagonist, counteracts the antiadhesive activities of
	aspirin. Exposure to U75302, an LTB(4) receptor antagonist, enhances
	the antiadesive effect of aspirin. (6) Reversal of antiadhesive activities
	of aspirin by celecoxib was associated with increased expression
	of LFA-1 on PMN and E-selectin on HUVEC. Addition of LXA(4), ZD2138
	and U75302 inhibited these changes. (7) The present results support
	the notion that inhibition of ATL formation is mechanistically linked
	to the reversal of the antiadhesive activity of aspirin caused by
	selective COX-1 inhibitors and suggests that the LTB(4)/ATL balance
	modulates pro- and antiadhesive activity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory

  abstract = {A detailed mechanism for the catalysis of prolyl isomerization by
	the rotamase enzyme FKBP is proposed on the basis of a model constructed
	from the known structure of the FK506/FKBP complex. The model substrate
	is bound as a type VIa proline turn with the ends exposed to permit
	longer polypeptide chains (e.g., protein loops) to act as substrates.
	An ab initio potential for the isomerized imide bond is combined
	with a molecular mechanics representation of the rest of the system
	to calculate the reaction path. The resulting activation energy for
	the enzymatic cis-->trans isomerization is equal to about 6 kcal/mol,
	in good agreement with experiment. The lowering of the barrier relative
	to the solution value of 19 kcal/mol is found to arise from a combination
	of desolvation of the imide carbonyl, ground-state destabilization,
	substrate autocatalysis, and preferential transition-state binding.
	Minimal rearrangements are required in the enzyme and the substrate
	along the reaction path. The enzyme residues that participate in
	catalysis agree with the available mutation data. The type VIa turn
	model corresponds to a sequence-specific structural motif commonly
	found on the surface of proteins. It is likely to have a role in
	the formation of protein complexes with FKBP-like domains that function
	as foldases or chaperones.},

	pathway, catalyses the chelation of Fe(II) into the protoporphyrin
	IX ring. The energetics of the binding between murine ferrochelatase
	and mesoporphyrin were determined using isothermal titration calorimetry,
	which revealed a stoichiometry of one molecule of mesoporphyrin bound
	per protein monomer. The binding is strongly exothermic, with a large
	intrinsic enthalpy (DeltaH=-97.1 kJ x mol(-1)), and is associated
	with the uptake of two protons from the buffer. This proton transfer
	suggests that hydrogen bonding between ferrochelatase and mesoporphyrin
	is a key factor in the thermodynamics of the binding reaction. Differential
	scanning calorimetry thermograms indicated a co-operative two-state
	denaturation process with a single transition temperature of 56 degrees
	C for wild-type murine ferrochelatase. An increase in the thermal
	stability of ferrochelatase is dependent upon mesoporphyrin binding.
	Similarly, murine ferrochelatase variants, in which the active site
	Glu-289 was replaced by either glutamine or alanine and, when purified,
	contained specifically-bound protoporphyrin, exhibited enhanced protein
	stability when compared with wild-type ferrochelatase. However, in
	contrast with the wild-type enzyme, the thermal denaturation of ferrochelatase
	variants was best described as a non-co-operative denaturation process.},

	includes more than 100 proteins and polypeptides derived from open
	reading frames translated from DNA sequences. Members of this family
	are widely distributed and have been found in the gamma subgroup
	of the proteobacteria, low- and high-G + C-content gram-positive
	bacteria, and cyanobacteria. These proteins are defined by a profile
	that can be accessed from PROSITE PS01124. Members of the family
	are about 300 amino acids long and have three main regulatory functions
	in common: carbon metabolism, stress response, and pathogenesis.
	Multiple alignments of the proteins of the family define a conserved
	stretch of 99 amino acids usually located at the C-terminal region
	of the regulator and connected to a nonconserved region via a linker.
	The conserved stretch contains all the elements required to bind
	DNA target sequences and to activate transcription from cognate promoters.
	Secondary analysis of the conserved region suggests that it contains
	two potential alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix DNA binding motifs. The
	first, and better-fitting motif is supported by biochemical data,
	whereas existing biochemical data neither support nor refute the
	proposal that the second region possesses this structure. The phylogenetic
	relationship suggests that members of the family have recruited the
	nonconserved domain(s) into a series of existing domains involved
	in DNA recognition and transcription stimulation and that this recruited
	domain governs the role that the regulator carries out. For some
	regulators, it has been demonstrated that the nonconserved region
	contains the dimerization domain. For the regulators involved in
	carbon metabolism, the effector binding determinants are also in
	this region. Most regulators belonging to the AraC/XylS family recognize
	multiple binding sites in the regulated promoters. One of the motifs
	usually overlaps or is adjacent to the -35 region of the cognate
	promoters. Footprinting assays have suggested that these regulators
	protect a stretch of up to 20 bp in the target promoters, and multiple
	alignments of binding sites for a number of regulators have shown

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An important prerequisite for computational structure-based
	drug design is prediction of the structures of ligand-protein complexes
	that have not yet been experimentally determined by X-ray crystallography
	or NMR. For this task, docking of rigid ligands is inadequate because
	it assumes knowledge of the conformation of the bound ligand. Docking
	of flexible ligands would be desirable, but requires one to search
	an enormous conformational space. We set out to develop a strategy
	for flexible docking by combining a simple model of ligand-protein
	interactions for molecular recognition with an evolutionary programming
	search technique. RESULTS: We have developed an intermolecular energy
	function that incorporates steric and hydrogen-bonding terms. The
	parameters in this function were obtained by docking in three different
	protein systems. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated
	by conformationally flexible docking of the inhibitor AG-1343, a
	potential new drug against AIDS, into HIV-1 protease. For this molecule,
	which has nine rotatable bonds, the crystal structure was reproduced
	within 1.5 A root-mean-square deviation 34 times in 100 simulations,
	each requiring eight minutes on a Silicon Graphics R4400 workstation.
	The energy function correctly evaluates the crystal structure as
	the global energy minimum. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that a solution
	of the docking problem may be achieved by matching a simple model
	of molecular recognition with an efficient search procedure. The
	necessary ingredients of a molecular recognition model include only
	steric and hydrogen-bond interaction terms. Although these terms
	are not necessarily sufficient to predict binding affinity, they
	describe ligand-protein interactions faithfully enough to enable
	a docking program to predict the structure of the bound ligand. This
	docking strategy thus provides an important tool for the interdisciplinary
	field of rational drug design.},

	microscopic routes on energy landscapes. At high temperatures, where
	traditional barriers are small, the remaining bottleneck is a search
	through denatured conformations to find thruway routes to the native
	state. Negative activation arises because increasing temperature
	expands the denatured ensemble, broadening the search, slowing the
	folding to the native state. We find that the upper estimate of the
	free energy barriers are positive but small, as little as 0.5 kT.},

	been considered in a number of theoretical papers, few methods of
	computing binding affinities are derived explicitly from this underlying
	theory. This has contributed to uncertainty and controversy in certain
	areas. This article therefore reviews and extends the connections
	of some important computational methods with the underlying statistical
	thermodynamics. A derivation of the standard free energy of binding
	forms the basis of this review. This derivation should be useful
	in formulating novel computational methods for predicting binding
	affinities. It also permits several important points to be established.
	For example, it is found that the double-annihilation method of computing
	binding energy does not yield the standard free energy of binding,
	but can be modified to yield this quantity. The derivation also makes
	it possible to define clearly the changes in translational, rotational,
	configurational, and solvent entropy upon binding. It is argued that
	molecular mass has a negligible effect upon the standard free energy
	of binding for biomolecular systems, and that the cratic entropy
	defined by Gurney is not a useful concept. In addition, the use of
	continuum models of the solvent in binding calculations is reviewed,
	and a formalism is presented for incorporating a limited number of
	solvent molecules explicitly.},

	The beta structural class of proteins was found to be the leader,

	the regular secondary structure is the largest, and second, the accessible
	surface area of packaged elements of the beta-structure increases
	more rapidly with increasing molecular mass in comparison with the

  abstract = {The simple plant location problem is a well-studied problem in combinatorial
	optimization. It is one of deciding where to locate a set of plants
	so that a set of clients can be supplied by them at the minimum cost.
	This problem often appears as a subproblem in other combinatorial
	problems. Several branch and bound techniques have been developed
	to solve these problems. In this paper we present two techniques
	that enhance the performance of branch and bound algorithms. The
	new algorithms thus obtained are called branch and peg algorithms,
	where pegging refers to fixing values of variables at each subproblem
	in the branch and bound tree, and is distinct from variable fixing
	during the branching process. We present exhaustive computational
	experiments which show that the new algorithms generate less than
	60% of the number of subproblems generated by branch and bound algorithms,
	and in certain cases require less than 10% of the execution times
	required by branch and bound algorithms. Scope and purpose. Locational
	decision problems of choosing the location of facilities to satisfy
	the demand of a set of clients at minimum costs constitute a very
	important class of practical problems. The simple plant location
	problem is a subclass of such problems, in which the facilities are
	supposed to have infinite capacities. These problems are used to
	model, among others, bank account location problems and in cluster
	analysis (refer, for example, to Cornuejols et al., in Discrete Location
	Theory, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1990, p. 119) and also, in
	recent times, to problems related to electronic business (refer to
	Fourer and Goux, Interfaces 31 (2001) 130). Not only are these problems
	important in themselves, but they also appear as subproblems in a
	much wider class of combinatorial problems, for example in crew scheduling,
	vehicle despatching, assortment, etc. The simple plant location problem
	is NP-Hard and there is much research on good algorithms for these
	problems. Effective solution techniques based on branch and bound
	algorithms have been suggested in the literature. In this paper we
	suggest techniques that substantially reduce the execution times
	of such algorithms. We think that these techniques can be used to
	enhance the performance of almost all the available solution algorithms
	for this problem. We hope that this paper will motivate research
	to apply the techniques suggested here to other problems},

  abstract = {A molecule can enter a zeolite channel when it fits the size and shape
	of the opening. Zeolites have been used commercially for their ability
	to admit selectively molecule A but not molecule B. The search and
	design of zeolites for separation has been based on finding a channel
	with a diameter that is larger than molecule A, but smaller than
	molecule B. This method is not sufficiently accurate when the molecule
	is not a sphere or the channel is not a circle. We present here first
	a more accurate screening method based on comparing both the major
	and minor diameters of the molecule projection, called the "footprint",
	with the diameters of the channel. Then we present an even better
	method that is based on the activation energy required to strain
	and distort a molecule to fit a given channel, thus leading to a
	lowering of its Boltzmann concentration in this channel. This paper
	compiles the activation energies encountered among thirty-eight (38)
	molecules and two hundred and seventeen (217) zeolite channels into
	a database, and shows how one can use this database to identify the
	most promising zeolites for the separation of a set of molecules
	of interest. Such a screening method would help to identify a zeolite
	that has much lower activation energy for molecule A than for molecule
	B. The appropriate temperature range for separation would be centered
	around the optimal temperature T*, where the degree of selectivity
	is at a maximum. The separation of the three pentane molecules was
	selected as an illustration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	(urea or Gu-HCl), combined with an increasing pH gradient, is introduced
	into a gel-filtration column packed with a gel medium that has an
	exclusion limit lower than the molecular mass of the protein to be
	refolded. A limited sample volume of the protein, dissolved in the
	highest denaturant concentration at the lowest pH of the selected
	gradient combination, is applied to the column. During the course
	of elution, the zone of denatured protein moves down the column at
	a speed approximately threefold higher than that of the denaturant.
	This means that the protein sample will gradually pass through areas
	of increasingly lower denaturant concentrations and higher pH, which
	promotes refolding into the native conformation. The shape and slope
	of the gradients, as well as the flow rate, will influence the refolding
	rate and can be adjusted for different protein samples. The principle
	is illustrated using a denatured recombinant scFv fusion protein
	obtained from E. coli inclusion bodies.},

	are examined to determine the effect of the environment on the behavior

	environment are found to be very similar to that found in the vacuum
	calculation. The primary difference in the average properties is
	that the equilibrium structure in the presence of solvent or the
	crystal field is significantly closer to the X-ray structure than
	is the vacuum result; concomitantly, the more realistic environment
	leads to a number density closer to experiment. The presence of solvent
	has a negligible effect on the overall magnitude of the positional
	or dihedral angle fluctuations in the interior of the protein; however,
	there are changes in the decay times of the fluctuations of interior
	atoms. For surface residues, both the magnitude and the time course
	of the motions are significantly altered by the solvent. There tends
	to be an increase in the displacements of long side chains and the
	flexible parts of the main chain that protrude into the solvent.
	Further, these motions tend to have a more diffusive character with

	a specific effect on a number of side chains which are held in relatively
	fixed positions through hydrogen-bond and electric interactions with
	the neighboring protein atoms. Most of the effects of the solution

	for uncovering biological insights. RESULTS: We determine the gene

	time-series data and show how the inferred network topology can be
	linked to sequence-level information hard-wired in the organism's
	genome. We propose a systematic way for determining the correlation
	threshold at which two genes are assessed to be co-expressed using
	the clustering coefficient and we expand the scope of the gene co-expression
	network by proposing the slope ratio metric as a means for incorporating
	directionality on the edges. We show through specific examples for
	B. subtilis that by incorporating expression level information in
	addition to the temporal expression patterns, we can uncover sequence-level
	biological insights. In particular, we are able to identify a number
	of cases where (1) the co-expressed genes are part of a single transcriptional
	unit or operon and (2) the inferred directionality arises due to
	the presence of intra-operon transcription termination sites. AVAILABILITY:

	Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set
	for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it
	applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing
	MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational
	and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94
	differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase
	processes in molecular-dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks
	to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small molecules in a combined "organic/protein"
	force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems
	of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that
	the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality
	computational data - ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the
	HF/6-31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level,
	380 MP2/6-31G* structures evaluated at a defined approximation to
	the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G*
	geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing
	feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety
	of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial chemists,
	including many that feature frequently occurring combinations of
	functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental data
	are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents
	a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the common "functional
	group" approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been determined
	in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational
	data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization
	very well. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths
	(0.014 A root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2&deg; rms), vibrational
	frequencies (61 cm<sup>-1</sup> rms), conformational energies (0.38
	kcal/mol rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly
	as well as does MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes
	intermolecular interactions in hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that
	closely parallels that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field.

	"MP4SDQ/TZP" calculations (triple-zeta plus polarization calculations

	error in some cases, the MMFF94 results appear excellent. Nevertheless,
	MMFF94 encounters somewhat greater difficulty in handling multifunctional
	compounds that place highly polar functional groups in close proximity,
	probably because it, like other commonly used force fields, too greatly

	the stepwise assembly process to be associated with characteristic
	conformational changes from random coil to ?-helical intermediates

	X-ray fiber diffraction analyses confirmed the concentration-dependent

	simulating peptide behavior in water revealed monomer antiparallel
	pairing to dimer structures by complementary structural alignment
	that further aggregated and stably condensed into coiled fibers.
	The ultrasmall size and the dynamic facile assembly process make
	this novel peptide class an excellent model system for studying the
	mechanism of amyloidogenesis, its evolution and pathogenicity. The
	ability to modify the properties of the assembled structures under

	The designed double mutant, N68C/A93C, in which the surface residues
	Asn68 and Ala93 were replaced by cysteines, formed dimers in solution
	and crystallized isomorphously to wild-type, but at a much faster

	crystals of cross-linked dimers ahd thermal factors somewhat lower

	to noticeably higher resolution. Introduction of the same cross-links

	and facilitates crystal growth. The disulfide cross-links are located
	on the 'back' of the molecule and formation of the cross-linked dimer
	appears to leave the active sites completely unobstructed. Nevertheless,
	the cross-linked dimer is completely inactive. One explanation for

	coli thioredoxin. The new binding site can be introduced with a minimum
	of four amino acid changes. The binding site is buried so that structural
	rules for making mutations in the hydrophobic core of a protein,
	as well as for the introduction of new functions, are being tested
	in this experiment. The mutant protein is folded even in the absence
	of metals, and variants that retain the original activity of thioredoxin
	can be isolated. The protein has gained a metal-binding site specific
	for transition metals. The metal co-ordination chemistry at the binding
	site varies depending on the metal that is introduced into it. Mercury(II)
	is co-ordinated in the expected manner. Copper(II) binds in a way
	that was not anticipated in the original design. It appears to use
	two of the four residues intended to form the co-ordination sphere,
	and two other residues that were not part of the original set of
	mutations. It is therefore necessary not only to introduce new functional
	groups to form a new site, but also to consider and remove alternative
	modes of binding.},

	RNA (21-23 nucleotides long), termed short interference RNA(siRNA),
	resulting in the downregulation of genes with cognate sequences [7-9].
	During transient siRNA-induced RNAi in mouse fibroblast cultures,
	we found significant reversible changes related to the telomeres.
	Telomeres acquired distinct heterochromatin features. There were
	increased bindings of Argonaute-1 (AGO1), telomeric repeat-binding
	factor 1(TERF1), and heterochromatin protein 1beta (HP1beta) on the
	telomeres. Histone H3 (lysine 9) was hypermethylated at the telomeres.
	The chromosome ends also were associated with an unidentified RNA.
	During RNAi, expression of a transgene inserted adjacent to the telomere
	was downregulated. In addition, the concentration of a group of heterogeneous
	high-molecular-weight RNA containing telomeric repeat sequences was
	increased, and this RNA formed a small number of transient, discrete
	nuclear foci. Our findings suggest that telomeres participate actively
	in the siRNA-induced RNAi process. These responses of telomeres to
	the RNAi process might partially account for the off-target effects
	of RNAi.},

	diverse roles. In addition, it was seen that different EC classes

	Further, we show that whilst the differences between EC classes in
	catalytic residue composition are not immediately obvious from the
	general classes of Ingold mechanisms, there is some weak correlation
	between the mechanisms involved in a given EC class and the functions
	that the catalytic amino acid residues are performing. The analysis
	presented here provides a valuable insight into the functional roles

	a redox enzyme which has a strong preference for NADH over NADPH

	In this report we examine the possibilities of altering the coenzyme
	specificity of LDH by introducing a range of different point mutations
	in the coenzyme-binding domain. Furthermore, after choosing the mutant
	with the highest selectivity for NADPH, we also investigated the
	possibility of further altering the coenzyme specificity by adding
	an organic solvent to the reaction mixture. The LDH mutant, I51K:D52S,
	exhibited a 56-fold increased specificity to NADPH over the wild-type
	LDH in a reaction mixture containing 15% methanol. Furthermore, the
	NADPH turnover number of this mutant was increased almost fourfold
	as compared with wild-type LDH. To explain the altered coenzyme specificity

	extensive use and testing, limitations in this force field, such

	We show that several of these continue to suffer from inadequate

	the approach used in most of these studies neglected to account for
	the existence in Amber of two sets of backbone ?/? dihedral terms.

  abstract = {The human mitochondrial NAD(P)(+)-dependent malic enzyme (m-NAD-ME)
	is a malic enzyme isoform with dual cofactor specificity and substrate
	binding cooperativity. Previous kinetic studies have suggested that
	Lys(362) in the pigeon cytosolic NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme has
	remarkable effects on the binding of NADP(+) to the enzyme and on
	the catalytic power of the enzyme (Kuo, C. C., Tsai, L. C., Chin,
	T. Y., Chang, G.-G., and Chou, W. Y. (2000) Biochem. Biophys. Res.
	Commun. 270, 821-825). In this study, we investigate the important
	role of Gln(362) in the transformation of cofactor specificity from
	NAD(+) to NADP(+) in human m-NAD-ME. Our kinetic data clearly indicate
	that the Q362K mutant shifted its cofactor preference from NAD(+)
	to NADP(+). The K-m(NADP) and k(cat(NADP)) values for this mutant
	were reduced by 4-6-fold and increased by 5-10-fold, respectively,
	compared with those for the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, up to
	a 2-fold reduction in Km(NADP)/Km(NAD) and elevation of k(cat(NADP))/k(cat(NAD))
	were observed for the Q362K enzyme. Mutation of Gln(362) to Ala or
	Asn did not shift its cofactor preference. The K-m(NADP)/K-m(NAD)
	and k(cat(NADP))/k(cat(NAD)) values for Q362A and Q362N were comparable
	with those for the wild-type enzyme. The Delta G values for Q362A
	and Q362N with either NAD(+) or NADP(+) were positive, indicating
	that substitution of Gln with Ala or Asn at position 362 brings about
	unfavorable cofactor binding at the active site and thus significantly
	reduces the catalytic efficiency. Our data also indicate that the
	cooperative binding of malate became insignificant in human m-NAD-ME
	upon mutation of Gln(362) to Lys because the sigmoidal phenomenon
	appearing in the wildtype enzyme was much less obvious that that
	in Q362K. Therefore, mutation of Gln(362) to Lys in human m-NAD-ME
	alters its kinetic properties of cofactor preference, malate binding
	cooperativity, and allosteric regulation by fumarate. However, the
	other Gln(362) mutants, Q362A and Q362N, have conserved malate binding
	cooperativity and NAD(+) specificity. In this study, we provide clear
	evidence that the single mutation of Gln(362) to Lys in human m-NAD-ME
	changes it to an NADP(+)-dependent enzyme, which is characteristic
	because it is non-allosteric, non-cooperative, and NADP(+)-specific.},

	has been studied by a combination of site-specific mutagenesis and
	reaction kinetics. Studies suggest that the overall protein structure
	and kinetic sequence for the reaction did not change for the mutant
	proteins compared to the wild-type enzyme. Two sets of mutated reductases
	have been constructed. The first set, in which the side chains of
	the targeted amino acids are spatially well separated (approximately
	8 A), includes two single mutants (L28Y and L54F) and a double mutant
	(L28Y-L54F). This set features residues that increased the side chain
	surface area and the potential for substrate interactions. Unexpectedly,
	nonadditivity in the free energy changes for the thermodynamics of
	ligand binding and in the rates of hydride transfer and product release
	is observed. The progressive increase in dihydrofolate binding is
	reversed for the sterically more crowded double mutant, with delta
	delta G ca. 3 kcal mol-1 less favorable than anticipated. On the
	other hand, the decrease in the rate constant for hydride transfer
	noted with the single mutants relative to the wild-type enzyme is
	reversed for the double mutant, so that delta delta G not equal to
	is ca. 2 kcal mol-1 more favorable. The second set of mutant proteins
	includes two double mutants (L28A-F31A and I50A-L54G) in which the
	selected amino acids are separated by three to four intervening amino
	acids and a quadruple mutant (L28A-F31A-I50A-L54G) in which the two
	sets L28A-F31A and I50A-L54G are spatially distinct. This set deleted
	the side chain surface area to lower the opportunity for substrate
	interactions. Nonadditivity in the free energy changes associated
	with key kinetic and thermodynamic parameters is again observed.
	The decrease in dihydrofolate binding found with the two double mutants
	is not observed with the quadruple mutant, which binds the substrate
	with delta delta G ca. 6.5 kcal mol-1 more favorable than expected.
	Similarly, the quadruple mutant has a larger rate constant for hydride
	transfer (-delta delta G not equal to congruent to 1.7 kcal mol-1)
	than predicted. One interpretation for the nonadditivity is that
	these residues interact through binding of the folate substrate,
	which serves to link molecularly remote side chain moieties within
	the active site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Jr., and C. L. Brooks III, J Chem Phys 2002, 116, 10606) we have
	recast the calculation of the self-electrostatic solvation energy
	to utilize a simple smoothing function at the dielectric boundary.
	The present GB model is formulated in this manner to provide consistency
	with the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory previously developed to yield
	numerically stable electrostatic solvation forces based on finite-difference
	methods (W. Im, D. Beglov, and B. Roux, Comp Phys Commun 1998, 111,

	efficient and accurate approach to reproduce corresponding PB solvation
	energies and forces. With only two adjustable parameters--a(0) to
	modulate the Coulomb field term, and a(1) to include a correction
	term beyond Coulomb field--the PB solvation energies are reproduced
	within 1% error on average for a variety of proteins. Detailed analysis
	shows that the PB energy can be reproduced within 2% absolute error
	with a confidence of about 95%. In addition, the solvent-exposed
	surface area of a biomolecule, as commonly used in calculations of
	the nonpolar solvation energy, can be calculated accurately and efficiently
	using the simple smoothing function and the volume integration method.
	Our implicit solvent GB calculations are about 4.5 times slower than
	the corresponding vacuum calculations. Using the simple smoothing
	function makes the present GB model roughly three times faster than
	GB models, which attempt to mimic the Lee-Richards molecular volume.},

	and stabilities of designed proteins to assess and improve the accuracy
	of design algorithms. RESULTS: Here we report the solution structure
	of a hydrophobic core variant of ubiquitin, referred to as 1D7, which
	was designed with the core-repacking algorithm ROC. As a measure
	of conformational specificity, we also present amide exchange protection
	factors and backbone and sidechain dynamics. The results indicate
	that 1D7 is similar to wild-type (WT) ubiquitin in backbone structure
	and degree of conformational specificity. We also observe a good
	correlation between experimentally determined sidechain structures
	and those predicted by ROC. However, evaluation of the core sidechain
	conformations indicates that, in general, 1D7 has more sidechains
	in less statistically favorable conformations than WT. CONCLUSIONS:
	Our results provide an explanation for the lower stability of 1D7
	compared to WT, and suggest modifications to design algorithms that
	may improve the accuracy with which structure and stability are predicted.
	The results also demonstrate that core packing can affect conformational
	flexibility in subtle ways that are likely to be important for the
	design of function and protein-ligand interactions.},

  abstract = {In the template-based modeling (TBM) category of CASP10 experiment,
	we introduced a new protocol called PMS (Protein Modeling System)
	to generate accurate protein structures in terms of side-chains as
	well as backbone trace. In the new protocol, a global optimization
	algorithm, called conformational space annealing (CSA), is applied
	to the three layers of template-based modeling procedure: multiple
	sequence-structure alignment, 3D chain building, and side-chain re-modeling.
	For 3D chain building, we developed a new energy function which includes
	new distance restraint terms of Lorentzian type (derived from multiple
	templates), and new energy terms that combine (physical) energy terms
	such as dynamic fragment assembly (DFA) energy, DFIRE statistical
	potential energy, hydrogen bonding term, etc. These physical energy
	terms are expected to guide the structure modeling especially for
	loop regions where no template structures are available. In addition,
	we developed a new quality assessment method based on random forest
	machine learning algorithm to screen templates, multiple alignments,
	and final models. For TBM targets of CASP10, we find that, due to
	the combination of three stages of CSA global optimizations and quality
	assessment, the modeling accuracy of PMS improves at each additional
	stage of the protocol. It is especially noteworthy that the side-chains
	of the final PMS models are far more accurate than the models in
	the intermediate steps. Â© Proteins 2013;. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals,

	a variety of metabolic reactions as well as controlling energy transduction,
	the transcription, and translation of genetic information, and signaling.
	They possess the remarkable capacity to accelerate reactions by many
	orders of magnitude compared to their uncatalyzed counterparts, making
	feasible crucial processes that would otherwise not occur on biologically
	relevant timescales. Thus, there is broad interest in understanding
	the catalytic power of enzymes on a molecular level. Several proposals
	have been put forward to try to explain this phenomenon, and one
	that has rapidly gained momentum in recent years is the idea that
	enzyme dynamics somehow contributes to catalysis. This review examines
	the dynamical proposal in a critical way, considering basically all
	reasonable definitions, including (but not limited to) such proposed
	effects as "coupling between conformational and chemical motions,"
	"landscape searches" and "entropy funnels." It is shown that none
	of these proposed effects have been experimentally demonstrated to
	contribute to catalysis, nor are they supported by consistent theoretical
	studies. On the other hand, it is clarified that careful simulation
	studies have excluded most (if not all) dynamical proposals. This
	review places significant emphasis on clarifying the role of logical
	definitions of different catalytic proposals, and on the need for
	a clear formulation in terms of the assumed potential surface and
	reaction coordinate. Finally, it is pointed out that electrostatic
	preorganization actually accounts for the observed catalytic effects

	flexibility of the kinetic intermediates in the enzyme reaction coordinate.
	Comparison of beta(s) with the cavity distribution in the crystal
	structures revealed that the flexibility of the intermediates was
	mainly determined by the total cavity volume with minor contributions
	of the number, position, and size of cavities. These results demonstrate
	that the compressibility is a useful measure of the conformational
	flexibility of the intermediates in the enzyme reaction and that
	the combined study of compressibility and X-ray crystallography gives
	new insight into the protein dynamics through the behavior of the

	GPCRs are found in a wide range of organisms and are central to a

	pharmaceutical research because they play a key role in many diseases.
	However, their tertiary structures remain largely unsolved. The methods

	profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and methods, including Support
	Vector Machines (SVMs), that transform protein sequences into fixed-length
	feature vectors. RESULTS: The last is the most computationally expensive
	method, but our experiments show that, for those interested in annotation-quality
	classification, the results are worth the effort. In two-fold cross-validation

	The method begins with a single target sequence and iteratively builds
	a hidden Markov model (HMM) from the sequence and homologs found
	using the HMM for database search. SAM-T98 is also used to construct
	model libraries automatically from sequences in structural databases.
	METHODS: We evaluate the SAM-T98 method with four datasets. Three
	of the test sets are fold-recognition tests, where the correct answers
	are determined by structural similarity. The fourth uses a curated
	database. The method is compared against WU-BLASTP and against DOUBLE-BLAST,
	a two-step method similar to ISS, but using BLAST instead of FASTA.
	RESULTS: SAM-T98 had the fewest errors in all tests-dramatically
	so for the fold-recognition tests. At the minimum-error point on
	the SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins)-domains test, SAM-T98
	got 880 true positives and 68 false positives, DOUBLE-BLAST got 533

	4B (PB-Seph 4B) affinity binding and endotoxin-protein dissociation
	with the dialyzable surfactant, octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (OBDG).
	Using the limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay to detect endotoxin,
	greater than 1000-fold reduction of endotoxin reactivity could be
	accomplished from a contaminated commercial preparation of bovine
	catalase. Importantly, this occurred with only a 24% protein loss
	and an 11% loss of catalase enzymatic activity after treatment. The
	treated catalase appeared to be largely endotoxin-free since it no
	longer elicited a pyrogenic response in rabbits or primed for intravascular
	coagulation of the generalized Shwartzman reaction. Of interest,
	OBDG treatment of Salmonella minnesota Re595 lipopolysaccharide enhanced
	its ability to bind to serum high density lipoproteins which might
	contribute to decreased in vivo toxicity. In quantitative studies
	using radiolabeled endotoxin, the OBDG was shown to be capable of
	dissociating protein-bound endotoxin thereby facilitating its binding
	to the PB-Seph 4B adduct. The technique was also useful in removing
	radiolabeled endotoxin added to human IgG. The methodology described
	here would be expected to have general usefulness in reducing endotoxin
	contamination of macromolecular solutions that can bind and retain
	endotoxin.},

	is one of the few able to efficiently utilize both NADPH and NADH
	as co-substrates in converting xylose into xylitol. In order to better
	understand the basis for this dual specificity, we have determined
	the crystal structure of XR from the yeast Candida tenuis in complex
	with NAD(+) to 1.80 A resolution (where 1 A=0.1 nm) with a crystallographic
	R -factor of 18.3%. A comparison of the NAD(+)- and the previously
	determined NADP(+)-bound forms of XR reveals that XR has the ability
	to change the conformation of two loops. To accommodate both the
	presence and absence of the 2'-phosphate, the enzyme is able to adopt
	different conformations for several different side chains on these
	loops, including Asn(276), which makes alternative hydrogen-bonding
	interactions with the adenosine ribose. Also critical is the presence
	of Glu(227) on a short rigid helix, which makes hydrogen bonds to
	both the 2'- and 3'-hydroxy groups of the adenosine ribose. In addition
	to changes in hydrogen-bonding of the adenosine, the ribose unmistakably
	adopts a 3'- endo conformation rather than the 2'- endo conformation
	seen in the NADP(+)-bound form. These results underscore the importance
	of tight adenosine binding for efficient use of either NADH or NADPH
	as a co-substrate in aldo-keto reductases. The dual specificity found
	in XR is also an important consideration in designing a high-flux
	xylose metabolic pathway, which may be improved with an enzyme specific
	for NADH.},

	superfamily of proteins. It catalyzes the first step in the assimilation
	of xylose, an aldose found to be a major constituent monosaccharide
	of renewable plant hemicellulosic material, into yeast metabolic
	pathways. It does this by reducing open chain xylose to xylitol,
	which is reoxidized to xylulose by xylitol dehydrogenase and metabolically
	integrated via the pentose phosphate pathway. No structure has yet

	Asp-178, Arg-181, Lys-202, Phe-206, Trp-313, and Pro-319. Alignments

	conserved in other dimeric xylose reductases but not throughout the
	remainder of the oligomeric aldo-keto reductases, predicting alternate
	modes of oligomerization for other families. An arrangement of side

	as a general acid. The loop that folds over the NAD(P)H cosubstrate
	is disordered in the apo form but becomes ordered upon cosubstrate
	binding. A slow conformational isomerization of this loop probably
	accounts for the observed rate-limiting step involving release of
	cosubstrate. Xylose binding (K(m) = 87 mM) is mediated by interactions
	with a binding pocket that is more polar than a typical aldo-keto
	reductase. Modeling of xylose into the active site of the holoenzyme

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli exhibits diauxic growth in
	sugar mixtures due to CRP-mediated catabolite repression and inducer
	exclusion related to phosphotransferase system enzyme activity. Replacement
	of the native crp gene with a catabolite repression mutant (referred
	to as crp*) enables co-utilization of glucose and other sugars in
	E. coli. While previous studies have examined the effects of expressing
	CRP* mutants on the expression of specific catabolic genes, little
	is known about the global transcriptional effects of CRP* expression.
	In this study, we compare the transcriptome of E. coli W3110 (expressing
	wild-type CRP) to that of mutant strain PC05 (expressing CRP*) in
	the presence and absence of glucose. RESULTS: The glucose effect
	is significantly suppressed in strain PC05 relative to strain W3110.
	The expression levels of glucose-sensitive genes are generally not
	altered by glucose to the same extent in strain PCO5 as compared
	to W3110. Only 23 of the 80 genes showing significant differential
	expression in the presence of glucose for strain PC05 are present
	among the 418 genes believed to be directly regulated by CRP. Genes
	involved in central carbon metabolism (including several TCA cycle
	genes) and amino acid biosynthesis, as well as genes encoding nutrient
	transport systems are among those whose transcript levels are most
	significantly affected by CRP* expression. We present a detailed
	transcription analysis and relate these results to phenotypic differences
	between strains expressing wild-type CRP and CRP*. Notably, CRP*
	expression in the presence of glucose results in an elevated intracellular
	NADPH concentration and reduced NADH concentration relative to wild-type
	CRP. Meanwhile, a more drastic decrease in the NADPH/NADP+ ratio
	is observed for the case of CRP* expression in strains engineered
	to reduce xylose to xylitol via a heterologously expressed, NADPH-dependent
	xylose reductase. Altered expression levels of transhydrogenase and
	TCA cycle genes, among others, are consistent with these observations.
	CONCLUSIONS: While the simplest model of CRP*-mediated gene expression
	assumes insensitivity to glucose (or cAMP), our results show that
	gene expression in the context of CRP* is very different from that
	of wild-type in the absence of glucose, and is influenced by the
	presence of glucose. Most of the transcription changes in response
	to CRP* expression are difficult to interpret in terms of possible
	systematic effects on metabolism. Elevated NADPH availability resulting
	from CRP* expression suggests potential biocatalytic applications
	of crp* strains that extend beyond relief of catabolite repression.}

	The specificity of the designed sequence for its template backbone

	the native sequence of the protein. We observe that while polar residues
	are well conserved in our designed sequences, non-polar amino acids
	at the surface of a protein are often replaced by polar residues.
	The designed sequences provide a multiple alignment of sequences

  author = {Konermann, Lars},
  abstract = {The biologically active (native) state of most proteins is characterised
	by a tightly folded and highly ordered conformation. Denaturants
	are chemical or physical agents that can induce unfolding of the
	polypeptide chain. Examples include urea, heat, extremes of pH, as
	well as some detergents. Unfolded proteins adopt a largely disordered
	structure. Denaturants can interact directly with the protein, or
	they can alter the properties of the surrounding aqueous environment.
	Despite the routine use of denaturants in the biochemical laboratory,
	the mechanisms whereby these agents destabilise the native state
	remain poorly understood. Folded protein structures are only marginally
	stable. As a result, relatively subtle alterations in the physical
	and chemical properties of the solvent can cause major changes in
	position of the unfolding equilibrium. This review briefly discusses
	the most commonly used denaturants, their likely mechanisms of action,
	as well as some thermodynamic aspects.Key Concepts:Key Concepts:
	
	* The biologically active (native) state N of proteins represents
	a highly ordered and tightly folded structure. * N is in equilibrium
	with an extensively disordered (unfolded) state U. * Denaturing agents
	(e.g. urea, extremes of pH and temperature) shift the unfolding equilibrium
	from N to U. * The exact mechanism of action remains unclear for
	most denaturants. * The position of the unfolding equilibrium is
	governed by an interplay of enthalpic and entropic contributions
	that affect the free energy of unfolding according to Î”G0=Î”H0â€“TÎ”S0.
	* The sign and magnitude of Î”G0 represents the thermodynamic stability
	of N; N is stable when Î”G0>0. * Unfolding can be triggered by increasing
	the temperature T, because U has a higher entropy than N (Î”S0>0).
	* Protein stability measurements are commonly carried out by employing
	urea or guanidinium chloride-induced unfolding in conjunction with
	optical detection. * Some proteins adopt semiunfolded structures
	(intermediates) under mildly denaturing conditions. * Protein (un)folding
	can be studied under equilibrium conditions and in kinetic experiments.},

	2 member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily of proteins

	mechanism of how it affects catalytic activity is outstanding. We
	have replaced His-113 by alanine using site-directed mutagenesis,
	determined a 2.2 A structure of H113A mutant bound to NADP(+), and
	compared catalytic reaction profiles of NADH-dependent reduction
	of different aldehydes catalyzed by the wild type and the mutant.
	Deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m
	xylose) show that, relative to the wild type, the hydride transfer
	rate constant (k(7) approximately 0.16 s(-1)) has decreased about
	1000-fold in H113A whereas xylose binding was not strongly affected.
	No solvent isotope effect was seen on k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m xylose)
	for H113A, suggesting that proton transfer has not become rate-limiting
	as a result of the mutation. The pH profiles of log(k(cat)/K(m xylose))
	for the wild type and H113A decreased above apparent pK(a) values
	of 8.85 and 7.63, respectively. The DeltapK(a) of -1.2 pH units likely
	reflects a proximally disruptive character of the mutation, affecting
	the position of Asp-50. A steady-state kinetic analysis for H113A-catalyzed
	reduction of a homologous series of meta-substituted benzaldehyde
	derivatives was carried out, and quantitative structure-reactivity
	correlations were used to factor the observed kinetic substituent
	effect on k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m aldehyde) into an electronic effect
	and bonding effects (which are lacking in the wild type). Using the
	Hammett sigma scale, electronic parameter coefficients (rho) of +0.64
	(k(cat)) and +0.78 (k(cat)/K(m aldehyde)) were calculated and clearly
	differ from rho(k(cat)/K(aldehyde)) and rho(k(cat)) values of +1.67
	and approximately 0.0, respectively, for the wild-type enzyme. Hydride
	transfer rate constants of H113A, calculated from kinetic parameters
	and KIE data, display a substituent dependence not seen in the corresponding
	wild-type enzyme rate constants. An enzymic mechanism is proposed
	in which His-113, through a hydrogen bond from Nepsilon2 to aldehyde
	O1, assists in catalysis by optimizing the C=O bond charge separation
	and orbital alignment in the ternary complex.},

	The relaxation kinetics are biphasic with a sub-microsecond phase

	dynamics simulations using an implicit solvent model. We test their

	Of particular interest is the fact that the refinement generally
	underestimates the atomic motions. Moreover, while the actual fluctuations
	go up to a mean-square value of about 5 A2, the X-ray results never
	go above approximately 2 A2. This systematic deviation in the motional

	in their probability distribution functions. For some atoms, the
	multiple peaks are seen in difference electron density maps and it
	is possible to include these in the refinement as disordered residues.

	the rest, leading to the observed errors in position and temperature
	factor. The use of strict stereochemical restraints is inconsistent
	with the average dynamical structure; nevertheless, refinement with
	tight restraints results in structures that are comparable to those
	obtained with loose restraints and better than those obtained with
	no restraints. The results support the use of tight stereochemical

  abstract = {Amyloid formation and accumulation is a hallmark of protein misfolding
	diseases and is associated with diverse pathologies including type
	II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro, amyloidogenesis
	is widely studied in conditions that do not simulate the crowded
	and viscous in vivo environment. A high volume fraction of most biological
	fluids is occupied by various macromolecules, a phenomenon known
	as macromolecular crowding. For some amyloid systems (e.g. α-synuclein)
	and under shaking condition, the excluded volume effect of macromolecular
	crowding favors aggregation, whereas increased viscosity reduces
	the kinetics of these reactions. Amyloidogenesis can also be catalyzed
	by hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces, represented by the air-water
	interface in vitro and diverse heterogeneous interfaces in vivo (e.g.
	membranes). In this study, we investigated the effects of two different
	crowding polymers (dextran and Ficoll) and two different experimental
	conditions (with and without shaking) on the fibrilization of amyloid-β
	peptide, a major player in AD pathogenesis. Specifically, we demonstrate
	that, during macromolecular crowding, viscosity dominates over the
	excluded volume effect only when the system is spatially non homogeneous
	(i.e. an air-water interface is present). We also show that the surfactant
	activity of the crowding agents can critically influence the outcome
	of macromolecular crowding and that the structure of the amyloid
	species formed may depend on the polymer used. This suggests that,
	in vivo, the outcome of amyloidogenesis may be affected by both macromolecular
	crowding and spatial heterogeneity (e.g. membrane turn-over). More
	generally, our work suggests that any factors causing changes in
	crowding may be susceptibility factors in AD.},

	A new optimization method is presented to search for the global minimum-energy
	conformations of polypeptides. The method combines essential aspects
	of the build-up procedure and the genetic algorithm, and it introduces
	the important concept of â€œconformational space annealing.â€? Instead
	of considering a single conformation, attention is focused on a population
	of conformations while new conformations are obtained by modifying
	a â€œseed conformation.â€? The annealing is carried out by introducing
	a distance cutoff, Dcut, which is defined in the conformational space;
	Dcut effectively divides the whole conformational space of local
	minima into subdivisions. The value of Dcut is set to a large number
	at the beginning of the algorithm to cover the whole conformational
	space, and annealing is achieved by slowly reducing it. Many distinct
	local minima designed to be distributed as far apart as possible
	in conformational space are investigated simultaneously. Therefore,
	the new method finds not only the global minimum-energy conformation
	but also many other distinct local minima as by-products. The method
	is tested on Met-enkephalin, a 24-dihedral angle problem. For all
	100 independent runs, the accepted global minimum-energy conformation
	was obtained after about 2600 minimizations on average. Â© 1997 John

	calculation of Born radii for every atom in the system. We introduce
	two new methods for determining Born radii. The first is a two-parameter

	is used in conventional Poisson calculations. The second is a five-parameter

	both algorithms employ a new empirically determined correction term
	that includes energetic effects beyond the Coulomb field approximation.
	With this correction term, the grid-based algorithm generally yields
	Born radii with greater than 0.99 correlation versus converged numerically
	derived Poisson Born radii. The analytical method reproduces Born
	radii with approximately 0.95 correlation versus Poisson-derived

	to the cation exchange capacity (CEC) binds ZEN primarily by a partition
	process. In contrast, clay exchanged at the 1.5 CEC level gave an
	S-shaped curve with at least two plateaus, suggesting additional
	mechanisms of adsorption. A capacity (Qmax) and distribution coefficient
	(Kd) for the first site were estimated. At acid pH, the adsorption
	capacity for 1.5 CEC CP clay decreased and the isotherm shape predicted
	a simple partition process. Conversely, the shape remained curved
	at alkaline pH, suggesting an adsorption site. These data imply an
	adsorption mechanism at neutral pH that involves hydrophobic attraction
	of ZEN into the interlayer in addition to multisite binding of the
	anionic form to hydroxyl groups on the edge of the clay via ion-dipole
	interactions and electrostatic attraction to excess exchanged surfactant
	cations. Keywords: Adsorption; cetylpyridinium; isotherm; mycotoxin;

	atoms in known protein structures. A complete set of van der Waals
	(VDW) radii for 24 protein atom types and for crystal-bound water
	is derived from the contact distance distributions of these atoms
	with a selected group of apolar atoms. In addition, a set of Coulombic
	radii for polar atoms is derived from their contacts with water.
	The contact distance distributions and the two sets of radii are
	derived in a systematic and self-consistent manner using an iterative
	procedure. The Coulombic radii for polar atoms are, on average, 0.18
	Ã… smaller than their VDW radii. The VDW radius of water is 1.7 Ã…,
	which is 0.3 Ã… larger than its Coulombic radius. We show that both
	the VDW and the Coulombic radii of polar atoms are needed in calculating
	the molecular and solvent-accessible surfaces of proteins. The VDW
	radii are needed to generate the apolar portions of the surface and
	the Coulombic radii for the polar portions. The fact that polar atoms
	have two apparent sizes implies that a hydrophobic cavity has to
	be larger than a polar cavity in order to accommodate the same number
	of water molecules. Most surface area calculations have used only
	one radius for each polar atom. As a result, unreal cavities, grooves,
	or pockets may be generated if the Coulombic radii of polar atoms
	are used. On the other hand, if the VDW radii of polar atoms are
	used, the details of the polar regions of the surface may be lost.
	The accuracy of the molecular and the solvent-accessible surfaces
	of proteins can be improved if the radii of polar atoms are allowed
	to change depending on the nature of their contacting neighbors.
	The surface of a protein at a proteinâ€“protein interface differs
	from that in solution in that it has to be generated using at least
	two kinds of probes, one representing a typical apolar atom and the
	other a typical polar atom. This observation has important implications
	for docking, which relies on surface complementarity at the interface.

  journal = {Microb Cell Fact},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {36},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The NAD(P)H-dependent Pichia stipitis xylose
	reductase (PsXR) is one of the key enzymes for xylose fermentation,
	and has been cloned into the commonly used ethanol-producing yeast
	Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In order to eliminate the redox imbalance
	resulting from the preference of this enzyme toward NADPH, efforts
	have been made to alter the coenzyme specificity of PsXR by site-directed
	mutagenesis, with limited success. Given the industrial importance
	of PsXR, it is of interest to investigate further ways to create
	mutants of PsXR that prefers NADH rather than NADPH, by the alternative
	directed evolution approach. RESULTS: Based on a homology model of
	PsXR, six residues were predicted to interact with the adenine ribose
	of NAD(P)H in PsXR and altered using a semi-rational mutagenesis
	approach (CASTing). Three rounds of saturation mutagenesis were carried
	to randomize these residues, and a microplate-based assay was applied
	in the screening. A best mutant 2-2C12, which carried four mutations
	K270S, N272P, S271G and R276F, was obtained. The mutant showed a
	preference toward NADH over NADPH by a factor of about 13-fold, or
	an improvement of about 42-fold, as measured by the ratio of the
	specificity constant kcat/Kmcoenzyme. Compared with the wild-type,
	the kcatNADH for the best mutant was only slightly lower, while the
	kcatNADPH decreased by a factor of about 10. Furthermore, the specific
	activity of 2-2C12 in the presence of NADH was 20.6 U.mg-1, which
	is highest among PsXR mutants reported. CONCLUSION: A seemingly simplistic
	and yet very effective mutagenesis approach, CASTing, was applied
	successfully to alter the NAD(P)H preference for Pichia stipitis
	xylose reductase, an important enzyme for xylose-fermenting yeast.
	The observed change in the NAD(P)H preference for this enzyme seems
	to have resulted from the altered active site that is more unfavorable
	for NADPH than NADH in terms of both Km and kcat. There are potentials
	for application of our PsXR in constructing a more balanced XR-XDH
	pathway in recombinant xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae strains.}

	To date, the highest affinity (10)Fn3 variants have been selected
	by mRNA display of libraries generated by randomizing all three complementarity-determining
	region -like loops of the (10)Fn3 scaffold. The sub-nanomolar affinities
	of such antibody mimics have been attributed to the extremely large
	size of the library accessible by mRNA display (10(12) unique sequences).
	Here we describe the selection and affinity maturation of (10)Fn3-based
	antibody mimics with dissociation constants as low as 350 pM selected
	from significantly smaller libraries (10(7)-10(9) different sequences),
	which were constructed by randomizing only 14 (10)Fn3 residues. The
	finding that two adjacent loops in human (10)Fn3 provide a large
	enough variable surface area to select high-affinity antibody mimics
	is significant because a smaller deviation from wild-type (10)Fn3
	sequence is associated with a higher stability of selected antibody
	mimics. Our results also demonstrate the utility of an affinity-maturation
	strategy that led to a 340-fold improvement in affinity by maximizing
	sampling of sequence space close to the original selected antibody
	mimic. A striking feature of the highest affinity antibody mimics
	selected against lysozyme is a pair of cysteines on adjacent loops,
	in positions 28 and 77, which are critical for the affinity of the
	(10)Fn3 variant for its target and are close enough to form a disulfide
	bond. The selection of this cysteine pair is structurally analogous
	to the natural evolution of disulfide bonds found in new antigen
	receptors of cartilaginous fish and in camelid heavy-chain variable
	domains. We propose that future library designs incorporating such
	an interloop disulfide will further facilitate the selection of high-affinity,

	conditions, resulting in gradual melting of native structure that
	permits resolving folding mechanisms step-by-step at atomic resolution.
	Experimental studies of one-state downhill folding have typically
	focused on the thermal denaturation of proteins that fold near the
	speed limit (ca. 10(6) s(-1)) at their unfolding temperature, thus
	being several orders of magnitude too fast for current single-molecule
	methods, such as single-molecule FRET. An important open question
	is whether one-state downhill folding kinetics can be slowed down
	to make them accessible to single-molecule approaches without turning
	the protein into a conventional activated folder. Here we address
	this question on the small helical protein BBL, a paradigm of one-state
	downhill thermal (un)folding. We decreased 200-fold the BBL folding-unfolding
	rate by combining chemical denaturation and low temperature, and
	carried out free-diffusion single-molecule FRET experiments with
	50-?s resolution and maximal photoprotection using a recently developed
	Trolox-cysteamine cocktail. These experiments revealed a single conformational
	ensemble at all denaturing conditions. The chemical unfolding of
	BBL was then manifested by the gradual change of this unique ensemble,
	which shifts from high to low FRET efficiency and becomes broader
	at increasing denaturant. Furthermore, using detailed quantitative
	analysis, we could rule out the possibility that the BBL single-molecule
	data are produced by partly overlapping folded and unfolded peaks.
	Thus, our results demonstrate the one-state downhill folding regime
	at the single-molecule level and highlight that this folding scenario
	is not necessarily associated with ultrafast kinetics.},

  abstract = {A method for optimizing potential-energy functions of proteins is
	proposed. The method assumes a hierarchical structure of the energy
	landscape, which means that the energy decreases as the number of
	native-like elements in a structure increases, being lowest for structures
	from the native family and highest for structures with no native-like
	element. A level of the hierarchy is defined as a family of structures
	with the same number of native-like elements (or degree of native
	likeness). Optimization of a potential-energy function is aimed at
	achieving such a hierarchical structure of the energy landscape by
	forcing appropriate free-energy gaps between hierarchy levels to
	place their energies in ascending order. This procedure is different
	from methods developed thus far, in which the energy gap and/or the
	Z score between the native structure and all non-native structures
	are maximized, regardless of the degree of native likeness of the
	non-native structures. The advantage of this approach lies in reducing
	the number of structures with decreasing energy, which should ensure
	the searchability of the potential. The method was tested on two
	proteins, PDB ID codes 1FSD and 1IGD, with an off-lattice united-residue

	the use of the conformational space annealing method and the newly
	optimized potential-energy function found the native structure very
	quickly, as opposed to the potential-energy functions obtained by
	former optimization methods. After even incomplete optimization,

  abstract = {All-atom force fields are now routinely used for more detailed understanding
	of protein folding mechanisms. However, it has been pointed out that
	use of all-atom force fields does not guarantee more accurate representations
	of proteins; in fact, sometimes it even leads to biased structural
	distributions. Indeed, several issues remain to be solved in force
	field developments, such as accurate treatment of implicit solvation
	for efficient conformational sampling and proper treatment of backbone
	interactions for secondary structure propensities. In this study,
	we first investigate the quality of several recently improved backbone
	interaction schemes in AMBER for folding simulations of a beta-hairpin
	peptide, and further study their influences on the peptide's folding
	mechanism. Due to the significant number of simulations needed for
	a thorough analysis of tested force fields, the implicit Poisson-Boltzmann
	solvent was used in all simulations. The chosen implicit solvent
	was found to be reasonable for studies of secondary structures based
	on a set of simulations of both alpha-helical and beta-hairpin peptides
	with the TIP3P explicit solvent as benchmark. Replica exchange molecular
	dynamics was also utilized for further efficient conformational sampling.
	Among the tested AMBER force fields, ff03 and a revised ff99 force
	field were found to produce structural and thermodynamic data in
	comparably good agreement with the experiment. However, detailed
	folding pathways, such as the order of backbone hydrogen bond zipping
	and the existence of intermediate states, are different between the
	two force fields, leading to force field-dependent folding mechanisms.},

	which permits stereospecific transfer of the 4-pro-R hydride from
	NAD(P)H to substrate, is achieved by hydrogen bonds formed between
	the C3-carboxamide of the nicotinamide ring and Ser 166, Asn 167,
	and Gln 190 and by pi-stacking between this ring and Tyr 216. These
	residues were mutated to yield S166A, N167A, Q190A, and Y216S. In
	these mutants, K(d)(NADP(H)) increased by 2-11-fold but without a
	significant change in K(d)(NAD(H)). Steady-state kinetic parameters
	showed that K(m)(NADP)()+ increased 13-151-fold, and this was accompanied
	by comparable decreases in k(cat)/K(m)(NADP)()+. By contrast, K(m)(NAD)()+
	increased 4-8-fold, but changes in k(cat)/K(m)(NAD)()+ were more

	the same residues stabilized the binding of NAD(H) only in the transition
	state. These observations suggest that different modes of binding
	exist for NADP(H) and NAD(H). Importantly, these modes were revealed
	by mutating residues in the nicotinamide pocket indicating that direct
	interactions with the 2'-phosphate in the adenine mononucleotide
	is not the sole determinant of cofactor preference. The single mutations
	were unable to invert or racemize the stereochemistry of hydride
	transfer even though the nicotinamide pocket can accommodate both
	anti- and syn-conformers once the necessary hydrogen bonds are eliminated.
	When 4-pro-R-[(3)H]NADH was used to monitor incorporation into [(14)C]-5alpha-dihydrotestosterone,
	a decrease in the (3)H:(14)C ratio was observed in the mutants relative
	to wild-type enzyme reflecting a pronounced primary kinetic isotope

	for NAD(P)(H) in the transition state suggests that these mutants
	have altered the reaction trajectory for hydride transfer.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The level of sequence conservation between related nucleic
	acids or proteins often varies considerably along the sequence. Both
	regions with high variability (mutational hot-spots) and regions

	molecules. The reliability of an alignment therefore strongly depends
	on the level of local sequence similarity. Especially in regions
	of high variability, many alignments of almost equal quality exist,
	and the optimal alignment is highly arbitrary.Results: We discuss
	two approaches which deal with the inherent ambiguity of the alignment
	problem based on the computation of the partition function over all
	canonical pairwise alignments. The ensemble of possible alignments
	can be described by the probabilities Pij of a match between position
	i in the first and position j in the second sequence. Alternatively,
	we introduce a probabilistic backtracking procedure that generates
	ensembles of suboptimal alignments with correct statistical weights.A
	comparison between structure based alignments and large samples of
	stochastic alignments shows that the ensemble contains correct alignments
	with significant probabilities even though the optimal alignment
	deviates significantly from the structural alignment. Ensembles of
	suboptimal alignments obtained by stochastic backtracking can be
	used as input to any bioinformatics method based on pairwise alignment

	Averaging over all groups and all proteins, there was no net improvement

	research groups who consistently do improve protein structures relative
	to a starting starting model. We compare various measures of quality

	methods from the Richardson group, and (iii) ensemble-based methods

	and the suitability of the predicted models to serve as templates
	for molecular replacement. On the whole, there is a general correlation
	among various measures. However, there are interesting differences.
	Sometimes a structure that is in better agreement with the experimental
	data is judged to be slightly worse by GDT-TS. This suggests that

  abstract = {Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields
	represent a powerful tool to obtain structure-function relationships
	at an atomic level, and are central in current efforts to solve the
	protein folding problem. The results from studies applying these
	tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields
	used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is
	crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in
	simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone,
	quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM) calculations
	were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides,
	and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular
	dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments.
	QM potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at
	the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were
	determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these molecules.
	The LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides
	were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides. These
	improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte
	Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function
	to contain peptide backbone phi, psi dihedral crossterms or a phi,
	psi grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations
	of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used
	to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with QM and
	crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the
	phi, psi dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction
	were required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22
	force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of phi
	and psi in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly,
	empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction
	for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences.
	These adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for the
	two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement with experimental
	crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of
	the CHARMM force field in treating proteins. This extension of the
	potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment
	of biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general.},

	with the use of a rat model of balloon angioplasty, whether a structural

	compstatin peptide with up to 264-fold higher activity; one of these
	analogs is now in clinical trials for the treatment of age-related
	macular degeneration (AMD). Here we used functional assays, surface
	plasmon resonance (SPR), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
	to assess the effect of modifications at three key residues (Trp-4,
	Asp-6, Ala-9) on the affinity and activity of compstatin and its
	analogs, and we correlated our findings to the recently reported
	co-crystal structure of compstatin and C3c. The KD values for the
	panel of tested analogs ranged from 10âˆ’6 to 10âˆ’8â€‰M. These differences
	in binding affinity could be attributed mainly to differences in
	dissociation rather than association rates, with a >4-fold range
	in kon values (2â€“10â€‰Ã—â€‰105â€‰Mâˆ’1â€‰sâˆ’1) and a koff variation
	of >35-fold (1â€“37â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’2â€‰sâˆ’1) being observed. The stability
	of the C3b-compstatin complex seemed to be highly dependent on hydrophobic
	effects at position 4, and even small changes at position 6 resulted
	in a loss of complex formation. Induction of a Î²-turn shift by an
	A9P modification resulted in a more favorable entropy but a loss
	of binding specificity and stability. The results obtained by the
	three methods utilized here were highly correlated with regard to
	the activity/affinity of the analogs. Thus, our analyses have identified
	essential structural features of compstatin and provided important
	information to support the development of analogs with improved efficacy.

  abstract = {We present new findings in our drug discovery effort to develop an
	anticomplement therapeutic. We have designed several active analogues
	of compstatin by altering its amino acid composition at positions
	4 and 9. The most effective analogues have tryptophan or fused-ring
	non-natural amino acids at position 4 and alanine or an unbranched
	single-methyl amino acid at position 9. Twenty-one of these analogues
	have 2-99-fold higher activities compared to the parent peptide compstatin.
	The analogue Ac-V4(2Nal)/H9A-NH(2) has the highest inhibitory activity
	with IC(50) 500 nM. NMR data, through NOE and chemical shift analysis,
	suggest the presence of interconverting conformers spanning the extended
	and helical regions of the Ramachandran plot, and they detect a predominant
	averaged conformer with coil structure and at least one flexible
	beta-turn, of type I. The fused-ring non-natural amino acids at position
	4 contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic cluster of compstatin,
	which has been previously proposed, together with the beta-turn and
	a disulfide bridge, to be essential for binding to the target of
	compstatin, complement component C3. We propose that additional mechanisms
	may contribute to the structural stability of the analogues and to
	binding to C3, involving intra- and intermolecular electrostatic
	interactions of the pi-electron system of side chain aromatic rings.
	The presence of pi-pi interactions for Trp4-Trp7 was confirmed with
	a molecular dynamics simulation for the most active analogue with
	natural amino acids, Ac-V4W/H9A-NH(2). Alanine or aminobutyric acid
	at position 9 contribute to the weak propensity for helical structure
	of the residue segment 4-10 of the analogues, which may also play
	a role in increased activity.},

  abstract = {A new approach is proposed for finding all epsilon-feasible solutions
	for certain classes of nonlinearly constrained systems of equations.
	By introducing slack variables, the initial problem is transformed
	into a global optimization problem (P) whose multiple global minimum
	solutions with a zero objective value (if any) correspond to all
	solutions of the initial constrained system of equalities. All epsilon-globally
	optimal points of (P) are then localized within a set of arbitrarily
	small disjoint rectangles. This is based on a branch and bound type
	global optimization algorithm which attains finite E-convergence
	to each of the multiple global minima of (P) through the successive
	refinement of a convex relaxation of the feasible legion and the
	subsequent solution of a series of nonlinear convex optimization
	problems. Based on the form of the participating functions, a number
	of techniques for constructing this convex relaxation are proposed.
	By taking advantage of the properties of products of univariate functions,
	customized convex lower bounding functions are introduced for a large
	number of expressions that are or can be transformed into products
	of univariate functions. Alternative convex relaxation procedures
	involve either the difference of two convex functions employed in
	alpha BB [23] or the exponential variable transformation based underestimators

	proposed approach is illustrated with several test problems. For
	some of these problems additional solutions are identified that existing

	NADPH-specific. Wild-type (WT) cytochrome b(5) reductase showed a
	3700-fold preference for NADH whereas the mutant with the highest

	hydantoinase from Arthrobacter sp. DSM 9771 into an L-selective enzyme
	and increased its total activity fivefold. Whole E. coli cells expressing

	racemase produced 91 mM L-met from 100 mM D,L-MTEH in less than 2

	>90% conversion of the substrate. The accumulation of the unwanted
	intermediate D-carbamoyl-methionine was reduced fourfold compared

  abstract = {The Wilson equation for the excess Gibbs energy has found wide use
	in successfully representing the behavior of polar and nonpolar multicomponent
	mixtures with only binary parameters but was incapable of predicting
	more than one liquid phase. The UNIFAC and ASOG group contribution
	methods do not have this limitation and can predict the presence
	of multiple liquid phases. The most important area of application
	of all these equations is in the prediction of phase equilibria.
	The calculation of phase equilibria involves two important problems:
	(i) the minimization of the Gibbs free energy and (ii) the tangent
	plane stability criterion. Problem ii, which can be implemented as
	the minimization of the tangent plane distance function, has found
	wide application in aiding the search for the global minimum of the
	Gibbs free energy. However, a drawback of all previous approaches
	is that they could not provide theoretical guarantees that the true
	equilibrium solution will be obtained. The goal of this work is to
	find the equilibrium solution corresponding to the global minimum
	of the Gibbs free energy. A proof that the Wilson equation leads
	to a convex formulation for the minimization of the Gibbs energy
	is provided so that a local optimization technique will always converge
	to a global minimum. In addition, new expressions are derived for
	the molar Gibbs free energy function when the UNIFAC, ASOG, and modified
	Wilson equations are employed. These expressions are then transformed
	so that application of a branch and bound based global optimization
	algorithm originally due to Falk and Soland (1969) is possible. This
	allows global solutions to be obtained for both the minimization
	of the Gibbs free energy and the minimization of the tangent plane
	distance function. The algorithm is implemented in C as part of the
	package GLOPEQ, global optimization for the phase equilibrium problem

	Gibbs free energy of the system be at its global minimum, or (ii)
	the minimum of the tangent plane distance function be nonnegative
	for all phase models used to represent the system, In this work,
	the goal is to obtain equilibrium solutions corresponding to a global
	minimum of the Gibbs free energy as efficiently as possible, for
	cases where the liquid phase or phases can be modeled by the NRTL,
	UNIQUAC, UNIFAC, Wilson, modified Wilson and ASOG equations. Vapor
	phases whose behavior can be described as ideal can also be handled.
	In achieving this goal, there are two distinct problems of relevance:
	(i) the minimization of the Gibbs free energy, denoted (G), and (ii)
	the minimization of the tangent plane distance function, or the tangent
	plane stability criterion, denoted (S). For all these activity coefficient
	models, GLOPEQ (GLobal OPtimization for the Phase and chemical EQuilibrium
	problem) can guarantee global solutions for problems (G) and (S),
	but a combined algorithm employs them in tandem, using (G) to generate
	candidate equilibrium solutions which can then be verified for thermodynamic
	stability by solving (S). Two key features of the combined algorithm
	are that (i) as much information as is possible is obtained from
	local searches, and (ii) it is preferable to verify a globally stable
	equilibrium solution using the tangent plane criterion, as this problem
	contains fewer variables than the minimization of the Gibbs free
	energy. Results for several examples are presented, and all but one
	of them are for the case of phase equilibrium, due to the paucity
	of examples for reacting systems that employ excess Gibbs free energy

	to play a central role in the electron-coupled proton transfer. Different
	charge sets for the [3Fe-4S] cluster in its reduced and oxidized
	state are calculated with broken symmetry ab initio density functional
	theory methods and used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The
	validity of the ab initio calculations is assessed by comparing partially
	optimized structures of the [3Fe-4S] clusters with x-ray structures.
	Possible proton transfer pathways between the protein and the iron-sulfur
	cluster are examined by both MD simulations and ab initio calculations.
	The MD simulations identify three main-chain hydrogen atoms--HN(13),
	HN(14), and HN(16)--that are within H-bonding distance of the [3Fe-4S]
	cluster throughout the MD simulations. They could thus play a role
	in the proton transfer from the protein to the iron-sulfur cluster.
	By contrast, the HD2(15) atom of the Asp-15 is seldom close enough
	to the [3Fe-4S] cluster to transfer a proton. Poisson-Boltzmann calculations
	indicate that there is a low, but nonzero probability, that Asp-15
	is protonated at pH 7; this is a requirement for it to serve as a
	proton donor. Ab initio calculations with a fragment model for the
	protein find similar behavior for the transfer of a proton from the
	OH of the protonated side chain and the main-chain NH of Asp-15.
	The existence of a stable salt bridge between Asp-15 and Lys-84 in
	the D15E mutant, versus its absence in the wild-type, has been suggested
	as the cause of the difference in the rate of proton transfer. Extensive
	MD simulations were done to test this idea; the results do not support
	the proposal. The present findings, together with the available data,
	serve as the basis for an alternative proposal for the mechanism
	of the coupled electron-proton transfer reaction in ferredoxin I.},

	To test this model, we targeted a single hydrogen bond occurring
	exclusively in the closed Met20 loop conformation. Specifically,
	Asp122 in the betaF-betaG loop was independently substituted with
	asparagine, serine, and alanine-amino acids with decreasing abilities

	the construction of kinetic schemes at pH 7.0 that demonstrate two
	striking features. First, a significant correlation exists between
	decreased binding of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate,
	reduced (NADPH), and decreased hydride transfer rates resulting from
	these mutations. In other words, the interactions of Asp122 are along
	the reaction coordinate leading to the transition state. Second,
	substitutions for Asp122 alter the catalytic pathway preferred by
	wild-type DHFR under saturating conditions of substrate and cofactor.
	Overall, the steady-state rate contains contributions from the product
	off rates from the DHFR.5,6, 7,8-tetrahydrofolate (H4F) and DHFR.NADPH.H4F
	complexes and from the rate of hydride transfer. These mutational

	Delta(146-148) DHFR mutant. Steady-state turnover rates for all mutants
	were at most 3-fold lower than the wild-type rate. Lack of an isotope
	effect on this rate indicated the chemistry step does not contribute
	to the steady-state turnover. Consistent with this finding, hydride
	transfer rates for the DHFR mutants were at least 10-fold greater
	than the observed steady-state rates. The values ranged from a 30%
	decrease (Ser148Ala and Ser148Lys) to a 50% increase (Ser148Asp)
	in rate relative to that of the wild type. Modifications of the betaG-betaH
	loop enhanced the affinity for the cofactor and decreased the affinity
	for pterin, as determined by the K(D) values of the mutant proteins.
	Further analysis of Ser148Ala and Delta(146-148) DHFRs indicated
	these effects were manifest mainly in ligand off rates, although
	in some cases the on rate was affected. The Ser148Asp and Delta(146-148)
	mutations perturbed the preferred catalytic cycle through the introduction
	of branching at key intermediates. Rather than following the single
	WT pathway which involves loss of NADP(+) and rebinding of NADPH
	to precede loss of the product H4F (negative cooperativity), the
	mutants can reenter the catalytic cycle through different pathways.
	These findings suggest that the role of the interloop interaction
	between the betaG-betaH loop and the Met20 loop is to modulate ligand
	off rates allowing for proper cycling through the preferred kinetic
	pathway.},

	at the next meal with the use of a within-subject design. DESIGN:
	Thirty-seven volunteers (19 men, 18 women) aged 20-29 y consumed
	isocaloric cola beverages (215 kcal) sweetened with sucrose, HFCS
	42, or HFCS 55. HFCS 42 contains 42% fructose, and HFCS 55 contains

	thirst, and satiety at baseline and at 20-min intervals after ingestion.
	A tray lunch (1708 kcal) was served at 1230, and energy intakes were
	measured. The free sugars content of sucrose-sweetened cola was assayed
	at the time of the study. RESULTS: We found no differences between
	sucrose- and HFCS-sweetened colas in perceived sweetness, hunger
	and satiety profiles, or energy intakes at lunch. The 4 caloric beverages
	tended to partially suppress energy intakes at lunch, whereas the
	no-beverage and diet beverage conditions did not; the effect was
	significant (P<0.05) only for 1%-fat milk. Energy intakes in the
	diet cola and the no-beverage conditions did not differ significantly.
	CONCLUSION: There was no evidence that commercial cola beverages
	sweetened with either sucrose or HFCS have significantly different
	effects on hunger, satiety, or short-term energy intakes.},

	subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic
	and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although
	neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein.
	The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several
	of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10
	differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers
	predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations
	similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts
	of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed
	structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within
	the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In
	the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree,

	This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules
	in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity
	of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein.
	While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost
	always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions
	may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience

	depend on how quickly its constituent alpha-helices can fold independently.
	Thus, our understanding of the protein folding problem may be greatly
	enhanced by a systematic survey of the folding rates of individual
	alpha-helical segments derived from their parent proteins. As a first
	step, we have studied the relaxation kinetics of the central helix
	(L9:41-74) of the ribosomal protein L9 from the bacterium Bacillus
	stearothermophilus , in response to a temperature-jump ( T-jump)
	using infrared spectroscopy. L9:41-74 has been shown to exhibit unusually
	high helicity in aqueous solution due to a series of side chain-side
	chain interactions, most of which are electrostatic in nature, while
	still remaining monomeric over a wide concentration range. Thus,
	this peptide represents an excellent model system not only for examining
	how the folding rate of naturally occurring helices differs from
	that of the widely studied alanine-based peptides, but also for estimating
	the folding speed limit of (small) helical proteins. Our results
	show that the T-jump induced relaxation rate of L9:41-74 is significantly
	slower than that of alanine-based peptides. For example, at 11 degrees
	C its relaxation time constant is about 2 micros, roughly seven times
	slower than that of SPE(5), an alanine-rich peptide of similar chain
	length. In addition, our results show that the folding rate of a
	truncated version of L9:41-74 is even slower. Taken together, these
	results suggest that individual alpha-helical segments in proteins
	may fold on a time scale that is significantly slower than the folding
	time of alanine-based peptides. Furthermore, we argue that the relaxation
	rate of L9:41-74 measured between 8 and 45 degrees C provides a realistic
	estimate of the ultimate folding rate of (small) helical proteins
	over this temperature range.},

	behavior seems to comply with classical two-state analyses, which
	imply the crossing of high free energy barriers. However, close inspection
	of chemical and thermal denaturation kinetic experiments in fast-folding
	proteins reveals systematic deviations from two-state behavior. Using
	a simple one-dimensional free energy surface approach we find that
	such deviations are indeed diagnostic of marginal folding barriers.
	Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of available fast-kinetic
	data indicates that many microsecond-folding proteins fold downhill
	in native conditions. All of these proteins are then promising candidates
	for an atom-by-atom analysis of protein folding using nuclear magnetic
	resonance.1 We also find that the diffusion coefficient for protein
	folding is strongly temperature dependent, corresponding to an activation
	energy of approximately 1 kJ.mol-1 per protein residue. As a consequence,
	the folding speed limit at room temperature is about an order of
	magnitude slower than the approximately 1 micros estimates from high-temperature
	T-jump experiments. Our analysis is quantitatively consistent with
	the available thermodynamic and kinetic data on slow two-state folding

	60-fold higher than that in xylitol oxidation and reflects significant
	differences in the corresponding catalytic centre activities as well
	as apparent substrate-binding constants. The enzyme prefers NADP(H)
	approx. 2-fold to NAD(H), which is largely due to better apparent
	binding of the phosphorylated form of the coenzyme. NADP+ is a potent
	competitive inhibitor of the NADH-linked aldehyde reduction (K-i

	In comparison, formic acid proceeds via direct, indirect and formate

	bond followed by the rapid activation of the O-H bond, was calculated
	to be the predominant path especially at potentials greater than
	0.6 V. The activation of the O-H bond of formic acid has a very low

	hydrolytic splitting of the C-O bond over stepped or defect sites
	in the indirect path, can build up and poison the surface. The results

  abstract = {Apoptosis is critical for organismal homeostasis and a wide variety
	of diseases. Caspases are the ultimate executors of the apoptotic
	programmed cell death pathway. As caspases play such a central role
	in apoptosis, there is significant demand for technologies to monitor
	caspase function. We recently developed a caspase activatable-GFP
	(CA-GFP) reporter. CA-GFP is unique due to its "dark" state, where
	chromophore maturation of the GFP is inhibited by the presence of
	a C-terminal peptide. Here we show that chromophore maturation is
	prevented because CA-GFP does not fold into the robust β-barrel of
	GFP until the peptide has been cleaved by active caspase. Both CA-GFP
	and GFP(1-10) , a split form of GFP lacking the 11th strand, have
	similar secondary structure, different from mature GFP. A similar
	susceptibility to proteolytic digestion indicates that this shared
	structure is not the robust, fully formed GFP β-barrel. We have developed
	a model that suggests that as CA-GFP is translated in vivo it follows
	the same folding path as wild-type GFP; however, the presence of
	the appended peptide does not allow CA-GFP to form the barrel of
	the fully matured GFP. CA-GFP is therefore held in a "pro-folding"
	intermediate state until the peptide is released, allowing it to
	continue folding into the mature barrel geometry. This new understanding
	of the structural basis of the dark state of the CA-GFP reporter
	will enable manipulation of this mechanism in the development of
	reporter systems for any number of cellular processes involving proteases

  abstract = {Microbial xylose reductase, a representative aldo-keto reductase of
	primary sugar metabolism, catalyzes the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction
	of D-xylose with a turnover number approximately 100 times that of
	human aldose reductase for the same reaction. To determine the mechanistic
	basis for that physiologically relevant difference and pinpoint features
	that are unique to the microbial enzyme among other aldo/keto reductases,
	we carried out stopped-flow studies with wild-type xylose reductase
	from the yeast Candida tenuis. Analysis of transient kinetic data
	for binding of NAD(+) and NADH, and reduction of D-xylose and oxidation
	of xylitol at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C provided estimates of rate
	constants for the following mechanism: E + NADH right arrow over

	arrow over left arrow E.NADH.D-xylose right arrow over left arrow
	E.NAD(+).xylitol right arrow over left arrow E.NAD(+) right arrow
	over left arrow E.NAD(+) right arrow over left arrow E + NAD(+).
	The net rate constant of dissociation of NAD(+) is approximately
	90% rate limiting for k(cat) of D-xylose reduction. It is controlled
	by the conformational change which precedes nucleotide release and
	whose rate constant of 40 s(-)(1) is 200 times that of completely
	rate-limiting E.NADP(+) --> E.NADP(+) step in aldehyde reduction
	catalyzed by human aldose reductase [Grimshaw, C. E., et al. (1995)
	Biochemistry 34, 14356-14365]. Hydride transfer from NADH occurs
	with a rate constant of approximately 170 s(-1). In reverse reaction,
	the E.NADH --> E.NADH step takes place with a rate constant of 15
	s(-1), and the rate constant of ternary-complex interconversion (3.8
	s(-1)) largely determines xylitol turnover (0.9 s(-1)). The bound-state
	equilibrium constant for C. tenuis xylose reductase is estimated
	to be approximately 45 (=170/3.8), thus greatly favoring aldehyde
	reduction. Formation of productive complexes, E.NAD(+) and E.NADH,
	leads to a 7- and 9-fold decrease of dissociation constants of initial
	binary complexes, respectively, demonstrating that 12-fold differential
	binding of NADH (K(i) = 16 microM) vs NAD(+) (K(i) = 195 microM)
	chiefly reflects difference in stabilities of E.NADH and E.NAD(+).
	Primary deuterium isotope effects on k(cat) and k(cat)/K(xylose)
	were, respectively, 1.55 +/- 0.09 and 2.09 +/- 0.31 in H(2)O, and
	1.26 +/- 0.06 and 1.58 +/- 0.17 in D(2)O. No deuterium solvent isotope
	effect on k(cat)/K(xylose) was observed. When deuteration of coenzyme
	selectively slowed the hydride transfer step, (D)()2(O)(k(cat)/K(xylose))
	was inverse (0.89 +/- 0.14). The isotope effect data suggest a chemical
	mechanism of carbonyl reduction by xylose reductase in which transfer
	of hydride ion is a partially rate-limiting step and precedes the

	a close relative of important human pathogens like Corynebacterium

	that a C. glutamicum mutant lacking serine/threonine protein kinase
	G (PknG) was impaired in glutamine utilization, proteome comparisons
	led to the identification of OdhI as a putative substrate of PknG.
	OdhI is a 15-kDa protein with a forkhead-associated domain and a
	homolog of mycobacterial GarA. By using purified proteins, PknG was
	shown to phosphorylate OdhI at threonine 14. The glutamine utilization
	defect of the delta pknG mutant could be abolished by the additional
	deletion of odhI, whereas transformation of a delta odhI mutant with
	a plasmid encoding OdhI-T14A caused a defect in glutamine utilization.
	Affinity purification of OdhI-T14A led to the specific copurification
	of OdhA, the E1 subunit of ODH. Because ODH is essential for glutamine
	utilization, we assumed that unphosphorylated OdhI inhibits ODH activity.
	In fact, OdhI was shown to strongly inhibit ODH activity with a Ki
	value of 2.4 nM. The regulatory mechanism described offers a molecular

	it has been assumed that an unknown three-dimensional structure can
	be obtained from a known homologous structure by substituting new
	side-chains into the polypeptide chain backbone, followed by relatively
	small adjustment of the model. To examine this approach of structure
	prediction and, more generally, to isolate the characteristics of
	native proteins, we constructed two incorrectly folded protein models.
	Sea-worm hemerythrin and the variable domain of mouse immunoglobulin
	K-chain, two proteins with no sequence homology, were chosen for
	study; the former is composed of a bundle of four alpha-helices and
	the latter consists of two 4-stranded beta-sheets. Using an automatic
	computer procedure, hemerythrin side-chains were substituted into
	the immunoglobulin domain and vice versa. The structures were energy-minimized
	with the program CHARMM and the resulting structures compared with
	the correctly folded forms. It was found that the incorrect side-chains
	can be incorporated readily into both types of structures (alpha-helices,
	beta-sheets) with only small structural adjustments. After constrained
	energy-minimization, which led to an average atomic co-ordinate shift
	of no more than 0.7 to 0.9 A, the incorrectly folded models arrived
	at potential energy values comparable to those of the correct structures.
	Detailed analysis of the energy results shows that the incorrect
	structures have less stabilizing electrostatic, van der Waals' and
	hydrogen-bonding interactions. The difference is particularly pronounced
	when the electrostatic and van der Waals' energy terms are calculated
	by modified equations that include an approximate representation
	of solvent effects. The incorrectly folded structures also have a
	significantly larger solvent-accessible surface and a greater fraction
	of non-polar side-chain atoms exposed to solvent. Examination of
	their interior shows that the packing of side-chains at the secondary
	structure interfaces, although corresponding to sterically allowed
	conformations, deviates from the characteristics found in normal
	proteins. The analysis of incorrectly folded structures has made
	it clear that the absence of bad non-bonded contacts, though necessary,
	is not sufficient to demonstrate the validity of model-built structures
	and that modeling of homologous structures has to be accompanied
	by a thorough quantitative evaluation of the results. Further, certain
	features that characterize native proteins are made evident by their
	absence in misfolded models.},

	faster folding can be achieved only by optimizing the turn propensity

	GB1 hairpin analogs spanning a wide range of thermodynamic stabilities

	changes in the reversing loop can act either by accelerating folding

	of an attractive side-chain/side-chain Coulombic interaction at the
	chain termini further stabilizes this hairpin. The 1.9-fold increase
	in folding rate constant observed for this change at the chain termini
	implies that this Coulombic interaction contributes before or at
	the transition state. This observation is difficult to rationalize
	by "zipper" folding pathways that require native turn formation as
	the sole nucleating event; it also suggests that Coulombic interactions
	should be considered in the design of systems intended to probe the

	be controlled by the viscosity of the solvent: Reducing the viscosity
	allows folding to accelerate. In the limit of very low solvent viscosity,
	however, one expects a different behavior. Internal interactions,
	occurring within the solvent-excluded interior of a compact molecule,
	should impose a solvent-independent upper limit to folding speed
	once the bulk diffusional motions become sufficiently rapid. Why
	has this not been observed? We have studied the effect of solvent
	viscosity on the folding of cytochrome c from a highly compact, late-stage
	intermediate configuration. Although the folding rate accelerates
	as the viscosity declines, it tends toward a finite limiting value
	approximately 10(5) s(-1) as the viscosity tends toward zero. This
	limiting rate is independent of the cosolutes used to adjust solvent
	friction. Therefore, interactions within the interior of a compact
	denatured polypeptide can limit the folding rate, but the limiting
	time scale is very fast. It is only observable when the solvent-controlled
	stages of folding are exceedingly rapid or else absent. Interestingly,
	we find a very strong temperature dependence in these "internal friction"-controlled
	dynamics, indicating a large energy scale for the interactions that
	govern reconfiguration within compact, near-native states of a protein.},

	coupled with the extreme level of SPIN identity in widely divergent
	tetrapods and the overall lack of selective constraint acting on

	DNA transposon activity ever recorded in any species lineage (nearly
	100,000 SPIN copies per haploid genome in tenrec). The process also
	led to the emergence of a new gene in the murine lineage derived

	structures in common (two "alpha-helices") and differ in the content
	of "alpha-helices" and "beta-strands" in the rest of their structures;
	i.e. for the native state, this part is alpha-helical, and for the
	latent state it is composed of beta-strands. Thus, the lattice protein
	free energy surface mimics that of amyloidogenic proteins that form
	well organized fibrils under appropriate conditions. A Go-like potential
	was used and the folding process was simulated with a Monte Carlo
	method. To gain insight into the equilibrium free energy surface
	and the folding kinetics, we have combined standard approaches (reduced
	free energy surfaces, contact maps, time-dependent populations of
	the characteristic states, and folding time distributions) with a
	new approach. The latter is based on a principal coordinate analysis
	of the entire set of contacts, which makes possible the introduction
	of unbiased reaction coordinates and the construction of a kinetic
	network for the folding process. The system is found to have four
	characteristic basins, namely a semicompact globule, an on-pathway
	intermediate (the bifurcation basin), and the native and latent states.
	The bifurcation basin is shallow and consists of the structure common
	to the native and latent states, with the rest disorganized. On the
	basis of the simulation results, a simple kinetic model describing
	the transitions between the characteristic states was developed,
	and the rate constants for the essential transitions were estimated.
	During the folding process the system dwells in the bifurcation basin
	for a relatively short time before it proceeds to the native or latent
	state. We suggest that such a bifurcation may occur generally for
	proteins in which native and latent states have a sizable part of
	their structures in common. Moreover, there is the possibility of
	introducing changes in the system (e.g., mutations), which guide
	the system toward the native or misfolded state.},

	Since then, many studies have taken advantage of this observation
	by targeting site-directed saturation mutagenesis (SDSM) to residues
	closer to or within enzyme active sites. Here, we have analysed a
	set of SDSM studies, in parallel to a similar set from EPPCR/DS,
	to determine whether the greater range of amino-acid types accessible
	by SDSM affects the distances at which the most effective sites occur.
	We have also analysed the relative effectiveness for obtaining beneficial
	mutants of residues with different degrees of natural sequence variation,
	as determined by their sequence entropy which is related to sequence
	conservation. These analyses attempt to answer the question-how well
	focused have targeted mutagenesis strategies been? We also compared
	two different sets of active-site atoms from which to measure distances
	and found that the inclusion of catalytic, substrate and cofactor
	atoms refined the analysis compared to using a single key catalytic
	atom. Using this definition, we found that EPPCR/DS is not effective
	for altering substrate specificity at sites that are within 5 A of
	the active-site atoms. In contrast, SDSM is most effective when targeted
	to residues at <5-6 A from the catalytic, substrate or cofactor atom,
	and also for residues with intermediate sequence entropies. Furthermore,
	SDSM is capable of altering substrate specificity at highly and completely
	conserved residues in the active site. The results suggest ways in
	which directed evolution by SDSM could be improved for greater efficiency
	in terms of reducing the library sizes required to obtain beneficial

	We call these regions unreliable local regions (ULRs). Accurate modeling
	of ULRs is of enormous value because they are frequently involved
	in functional specificity. In this article, we introduce a new method
	for modeling ULRs in template-based models by employing a sophisticated
	loop modeling technique. Combined with our previous study on protein
	termini, the method is applicable to refinement of both loop and
	terminus ULRs. A large-scale test carried out in a blind fashion
	in CASP9 (the 9th Critical Assessment of techniques for protein structure

	models by refinement in more than 70\% of the successfully detected
	ULRs. It is also notable that successful modeling of several long

	steroid hormone levels. cDNA cloning indicates that the rat and human
	liver isoforms display high sequence identity and that they belong
	to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. Of these the most extensively
	characterized is rat liver 3 alpha-HSD. The recently solved X-ray
	crystal structure shows that this enzyme adopts an (alpha/beta)8-barrel
	scaffold (Hoog et al. 1994). NAD(P)H binds in an extended anti-conformation
	and lies along the inner surface of the barrel. The nicotinamide
	ring is stabilized by interaction with Y216. The 4-pro(R)-hydrogen
	transferred in the reaction is in close proximity to Y55. K84, D50
	and H117 which are implicated in catalysis. These residues are located
	at the base of a hydrophobic pocket which is presumed to be involved
	in binding steroid hormone. This catalytic tetrad is conserved in
	members of the AKR superfamily. Mutant enzymes support roles for
	Y55 in steroid binding and for K84 as the general acid involved in
	catalysis. The gene for rat 3 alpha-HSD has been cloned and is 47
	kb in length and contains 9 exon-intron boundaries which are highly
	conserved in the human gene(s). The 5'-flanking regions of the rat

	copies of perfect and imperfect steroid hormone response elements
	(REs) (estrogen, glucocorticoid (GRE), and progesterone) which may
	comprise a steroid response unit (SRU) (Lin & Penning 1995). Constitutive
	and regulated expression of the rat 3 alpha-HSD gene has been studied
	by transiently transfecting reporter gene (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase,
	CAT) constructs into human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. With respect to
	the transcription start-site (+1), a proximal (-498 to -199bp) and
	distal (-20 to -4.0kb) enhancer, as well as a powerful silencer (-755
	to -498 bp) were located in the promoter. Band-shift and supershift
	assays provide evidence that Oct-1 binds to the silencer. Tandem
	repeats of the imperfect proximal and distal GREs that reside in
	the SRU were inserted into tk-CAT vectors and transiently transfected.
	Stimulation of transfected cells with dexamethasone resulted in robust

  abstract = {Mammalian 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3 alpha-HSDs) inactivate
	circulating steroid hormones, and in target tissues regulate the
	occupancy of steroid hormone receptors. Molecular cloning indicates
	that 3 alpha-HSDs are members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily
	and display high sequence identity (> 60%). Of these, the most extensively
	characterized is rat liver 3 alpha-HSD. X-ray crystal structures
	of the apoenzyme and the E.NADP+ complex have been determined and
	serve as structural templates for other 3 alpha-HSDs. These structures
	reveal that rat liver 3 alpha-HSD adopts an (alpha/beta)8-barrel
	protein fold. NAD(P)(H) lies perpendicular to the barrel axis in
	an extended conformation, with the nicotinamide ring at the core
	of the barrel, and the adenine ring at the periphery of the structure.
	The nicotinamide ring is stabilized by interaction with Y216, S166,
	D167, and Q190, so that the A-face points into the vacant active
	site. The 4-pro-(R) hydrogen transferred in the oxidoreduction of
	steroids is in close proximity to a catalytic tetrad that consists
	of D50, Y55, K84, and H117. A water molecule is within hydrogen bond
	distance of H117 and Y55, and its position may mimic the position
	of the carbonyl of a 3-ketosteroid substrate. The catalytic tetrad
	is conserved in members of the AKR superfamily and resides at the
	base of an apolar cleft implicated in binding steroid hormone. The
	apolar cleft consists of a side of apolar residues (L54, W86, F128,
	and F129), and opposing this side is a flexible loop that contains
	W227. These constraints suggest that the alpha-face of the steroid
	would orient itself along that side of the cleft containing W86.
	Site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic tetrad indicates that
	Y55 and K84 are essential for catalysis. Y55S and Y55F mutants are
	catalytically inactive, but still form binary (E.NADPH) and ternary
	(E.NADH.Testosterone) complexes; by contrast K84R and K84M mutants
	are catalytically inactive, but do not bind steroid hormone. The
	reliance on a Tyr/Lys pair is reminiscent of catalytic mechanisms
	proposed for other AKR members as well as for HSDs that belong to
	the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, in which Tyr
	is the general acid, with its pKa being lowered by Lys. Superimposition
	of the nicotinamide rings in the structures of 3 alpha-HSD (an AKR)
	and 3 alpha, 20 beta-HSD (an SDR) show that the Tyr/Lys pairs are
	positionally conserved, suggesting convergent evolution across protein
	families to a common mechanism for HSD catalysis. W86Y and W227Y
	mutants bind testosterone to the E.NADH complex, with effective increases
	in Kd of 8- and 20-fold. These data provide the first evidence that
	the side of the apolar cleft containing W86 and the opposing flexible
	loop containing W227 are parts of the steroid-binding site. Detailed
	mutagenesis studies of the apolar cleft and elucidation of a ternary
	complex structure will ultimately provide details of the determinants
	that govern steroid hormone recognition. These determinants could
	provide a rational basis for structure-based inhibitor design.},

  abstract = {Non-rotameric ("off-rotamer") conformations are commonly observed
	for the side-chains of protein crystal structures. This study examines
	whether such conformations are real or artifactual by comparing the
	energetics of on and off-rotamer side-chain conformations calculated
	with the CHARMM energy function. Energy-based predictions of side-chain
	orientation are carried out by rigid-geometry mapping in the presence
	of the fixed protein environment for 1709 non-polar side-chains in
	24 proteins for which high-resolution (2.0 A or better) structures
	are available. For on-rotamer conformations, 97.6 % are correctly
	predicted; i.e. they correspond to the absolute minima of their local
	side-chain energy maps (generally to within 10 degrees or less).
	By contrast, for the observed off-rotamer side-chain conformations,
	63.8 % are predicted correctly. This difference is statistically
	significant (P<0.001) and suggests that while most of the observed
	off-rotamer conformations are real, many of the erroneously predicted
	ones are likely to be artifacts of the X-ray refinements. Probabilities
	for off-rotamer conformations of the non-polar side-chains are calculated
	to be 5.0-6.1 % by adaptive umbrella-sampled molecular dynamics trajectories
	of individual amino acid residues in vacuum and in the presence of
	an average protein or aqueous dielectric environment. These results
	correspond closely to the 5.7 % off-rotamer fraction predicted by
	the rigid-geometry mapping studies. Since these values are about
	one-half of the 10.2 % off-rotamer fraction observed in the X-ray
	structures, they support the conclusion that many of the latter are
	artifacts. In both the rigid-geometry mapping and the molecular dynamics
	studies, the discrepancies between the predicted and observed fractions
	of off-rotamer conformations are largest for leucine residues (approximately
	6 % versus 16.6 %). The simulations for the isolated amino acid residues
	indicate that the real off-rotamer frequency of 5-6 % is consistent
	with the internal side-chain and local side-chain-backbone energetics
	and does not originate from shifts due to the protein. The present
	results suggest that energy-based rotation maps can be used to find
	side-chain positional artifacts that appear in crystal structures

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Homology modeling is an important technique for making
	use of the rapidly increasing number of protein sequences in the
	absence of structural information. The major problems in such modeling,
	once the alignment has been made, concern the positions of loops
	and the orientations of sidechains. Although progress has been made
	in recent years for sidechain prediction, current methods appear
	to have a limit on the order of 70% in their accuracy. It is important
	to have an understanding of this limitation, which for energy-based
	methods could arise from inaccuracies of the potential function.
	RESULTS: A test of the CHARMM function for sidechain prediction was
	performed. To eliminate the multiple-residue search problem, the
	minimum energy positions of individual sidechains in ten proteins
	were calculated in the presence of all other sidechains in their
	crystal orientations. This test provides a necessary condition that
	any energy function useful for sidechain placement must satisfy.
	For chi1 x chi2 rotations, the accuracies were 77.4% and 89.5%, respectively,
	and in the presence of crystal waters were 86.5% and 94.9%, respectively.
	If there was an error, the crystal structure usually corresponded
	to an alternative local minimum on the calculated energy map. Prediction
	accuracy correlated with the size of the energy gap between primary
	and secondary minima. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the
	errors in current sidechain prediction schemes cannot be attributed
	to the potential energy function per se. The test used here establishes
	a necessary condition that any proposed energy-based sidechain prediction
	method, as well as many statistically based methods, must satisfy.},

	Molecular dynamics simulations of myoglobin and heme-imidazole subsequent

	of the protein triggered by a perturbation such as ligand dissociation.
	The importance of these two processes is expected to depend on the

	nonequilibrium relaxation. Since NO rebinding occurs on the picosecond

	kinetics. The general implications of the present results for ligand

	reaction mechanism has been analyzed in order to establish how the
	mechanism should be kinetically designed in order to optimize the
	catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for a given average magnitude
	of true and apparent first-order rate constants in the mechanism
	at given concentrations of enzyme, substrate and product. 2. As long
	as on-velocity constants for substrate and product binding to the
	enzyme have not reached the limiting value for a diffusion-controlled
	association process, the optimal state of enzyme operation will be
	characterized by forward (true and apparent) first-order rate constants
	of equal magnitude and reverse rate constants of equal magnitude.
	The drop in free energy driving the catalysed reaction will occur
	to an equal extent for each reaction step in the mechanism. All internal
	equilibrium constants will be of equal magnitude and reflect only
	the closeness of the catalysed reaction to equilibrium conditions.
	3. When magnitudes of on-velocity constants for substrate and product
	binding have reached their upper limits, the optimal kinetic design
	of the reaction mechanism becomes more complex and has to be established
	by numerical methods. Numerical solutions, calculated for triosephosphate
	isomerase, indicate that this particular enzyme may or may not be
	considered to exhibit close to maximal efficiency, depending on what
	value is assigned to the upper limit for a ligand association rate
	constant. 4. Arguments are presented to show that no useful information
	on the evolutionary optimization of the catalytic efficiency of enzymes
	can be obtained by previously taken approaches that are based on
	the application of linear free-energy relationships for rate and
	equilibrium constants in the reaction mechanism.},

	insights into protein interactions. We have developed an algorithm
	M-ZDOCK for predicting the structure of cyclically symmetric (Cn)
	multimers based on the structure of an unbound (or partially bound)
	monomer. Using a grid-based Fast Fourier Transform approach, a space
	of exclusively symmetric multimers is searched for the best structure.
	This leads to improvements both in accuracy and running time over
	the alternative, which is to run a binary docking program ZDOCK and
	filter the results for near-symmetry. The accuracy is improved because
	fewer false positives are considered in the search, thus hits are
	not as easily overlooked. By searching four instead of six degrees
	of freedom, the required amount of computation is reduced. This program
	has been tested on several known multimer complexes from the Protein
	DataBank, including four unbound multimers: three trimers and a pentamer.
	For all of these cases, M-ZDOCK was able to find at least one hit,
	whereas only two of the four testcases had hits when using ZDOCK
	and a symmetry filter. In addition, the running times are 30-40%
	faster for M-ZDOCK. AVAILABILITY: M-ZDOCK is freely available to

	3-7 additional amino acid insertions, were constructed and characterized

	the VLI dihydrofolate reductase is the first mutant form of E. coli
	DHFR to display enhanced specificity for folate [(kcat/Km)mutant/(kcat/Km)wt

	was examined by using molecular dynamics to calculate positional
	fluctuations of individual helix, beta-sheet, and loop structural
	elements in free and substrate-bound hen egg-white lysozyme. The
	time development of the fluctuations revealed a general correspondence
	between structure and dynamics; the fluctuations of the helices and
	beta-sheets converged within the 101 psec period of the simulation
	and were lower than average in magnitude, while the fluctuations
	of the loop regions were not converged and were mostly larger than
	average in magnitude. Notable exceptions to this pattern occurred
	in the substrate-bound simulation. A loop region (residues 101-107)
	of the active site cleft had significantly reduced motion due to
	interactions with the substrate. Moreover, part of a loop and a 3(10)
	helix (residues of 67-88) not in contact with the substrate showed
	a marked increase in fluctuations. That these differences in dynamics
	of free and substrate-bound lysozyme did not result simply from sampling
	errors was established by an analysis of the variations in the fluctuations
	of the two halves of the 101 psec simulation of free lysozyme. Concerted
	transitions of four to five mainchain phi and psi angles between
	dihedral wells were shown to be responsible for large coordinate
	shifts in the loops. These transitions displaced six or fewer residues
	and took place either abruptly, in 1 psec or less, or with a diffusive
	character over 5-10 psec. Displacements of rigid secondary structures
	involved longer timescale motions in bound lysozyme; a 0.5 A rms
	change in the position of a helix occurred over the 55 psec simulation
	period. This helix reorientation within the protein appears to be
	a response to substrate binding. There was little correlation between
	the solvent accessible surface area and the dynamics of the different

	we compare the two principal approaches for sharing software between
	different programming languages: either by remote procedure call

	protocol over a network interface; examples are RSOAP and Rserve.
	The local call stack provides a between-language mapping not over

	are R bindings, RPy, and languages sharing the Java Virtual Machine
	stack. This functionality provides strategies for sharing of software

	work, we develop a scoring function using support vector regression
	(SVR). Both consensus-based features and features from individual
	structures are extracted from a training data set containing native
	protein structures and predicted structural models submitted to CASP5
	and CASP6. The SVR learns a scoring function that is a linear combination
	of these features. We test this scoring function on two data sets.
	First, when used to rank server models submitted to CASP7, the SVR
	score selects predictions that are comparable to the best performing
	server in CASP7, Zhang-Server, and significantly better than all
	the other servers. Even if the SVR score is not allowed to select
	Zhang-Server models, the SVR score still selects predictions that
	are significantly better than all the other servers. In addition,
	the SVR is able to select significantly better models and yield significantly
	better Pearson correlation coefficients than the two best Quality
	Assessment groups in CASP7, QA556 (LEE), and QA634 (Pcons). Second,
	this work aims to improve the ability of the Robetta server to select
	best models, and hence we evaluate the performance of the SVR score
	on ranking the Robetta server template-based models for the CASP7
	targets. The SVR selects significantly better models than the Robetta

	a longstanding challenge in molecular biology and structure-based
	drug design. Although homology modeling techniques are widely used
	to produce low-resolution models, refining these models to high resolution
	has proven difficult. With long enough simulations and sufficiently
	accurate force fields, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should
	in principle allow such refinement, but efforts to refine homology
	models using MD have for the most part yielded disappointing results.
	It has thus far been unclear whether MD-based refinement is limited
	primarily by accessible simulation timescales, force field accuracy,
	or both. Here, we examine MD as a technique for homology model refinement
	using all-atom simulations, each at least 100 Î¼s longâ€”more than
	100 times longer than previous refinement simulationsâ€”and a physics-based
	force field that was recently shown to successfully fold a structurally
	diverse set of fast-folding proteins. In MD simulations of 24 proteins
	chosen from the refinement category of recent Critical Assessment
	of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments, we find that in most
	cases, simulations initiated from homology models drift away from
	the native structure. Comparison with simulations initiated from
	the native structure suggests that force field accuracy is the primary
	factor limiting MD-based refinement. This problem can be mitigated
	to some extent by restricting sampling to the neighborhood of the
	initial model, leading to structural improvement that, while limited,
	is roughly comparable to the leading alternative methods. Proteins

  year = {2012},
  volume = {13},
  pages = {224},
  abstract = {Employing methods to assess the quality of modeled protein structures
	is now standard practice in bioinformatics. In a broad sense, the
	techniques can be divided into methods relying on consensus prediction
	on the one hand, and single-model methods on the other. Consensus
	methods frequently perform very well when there is a clear consensus,
	but this is not always the case. In particular, they frequently fail
	in selecting the best possible model in the hard cases (lacking consensus)
	or in the easy cases where models are very similar. In contrast,
	single-model methods do not suffer from these drawbacks and could
	potentially be applied on any protein of interest to assess quality
	or as a scoring function for sampling-based refinement.Here, we present
	a new single-model method, ProQ2, based on ideas from its predecessor,
	ProQ. ProQ2 is a model quality assessment algorithm that uses support
	vector machines to predict local as well as global quality of protein
	models. Improved performance is obtained by combining previously
	used features with updated structural and predicted features. The
	most important contribution can be attributed to the use of profile
	weighting of the residue specific features and the use features averaged
	over the whole model even though the prediction is still local.ProQ2
	is significantly better than its predecessors at detecting high quality
	models, improving the sum of Z-scores for the selected first-ranked
	models by 20\% and 32\% compared to the second-best single-model
	method in CASP8 and CASP9, respectively. The absolute quality assessment
	of the models at both local and global level is also improved. The
	Pearson's correlation between the correct and local predicted score
	is improved from 0.59 to 0.70 on CASP8 and from 0.62 to 0.68 on CASP9;

	two distinct groups of DNA transposons, in the lineage of the vespertilionid
	bat Myotis lucifugus. Here, we describe seven additional families

	and Tc2-like elements. This was followed by the colonization of Tc1-like
	elements, and by a more recent explosion of hAT-like elements. Finally,
	and most recently, piggyBac-like elements have amplified within the
	Myotis genome and our results indicate that one of these families
	is probably still expanding in natural populations. Together, these
	data suggest that there has been tremendous recent activity of various
	DNA transposons in the bat lineage that far exceeds those previously
	reported for any mammalian lineage. The diverse and recent populations
	of DNA transposons in genus Myotis will provide an unprecedented

	and to assess the relation between complement activation, NAFLD severity,
	apoptosis, and inflammatory parameters. Liver biopsies of 43 obese
	subjects with various degrees of NAFLD and of 10 healthy controls
	were analyzed for deposition of complement factors C1q, mannose-binding
	lectin (MBL), C4d, activated C3, and membrane attack complex (MAC)-associated

	pro-inflammatory cytokine expression were quantified. Whereas complement
	activation was undetectable in the liver of healthy subjects, 74\%
	of the NAFLD patients showed hepatic deposition of activated C3 and
	C4d. C1q as well as MBL accumulation was found in most activated
	C3-positive patients. Strikingly, 50\% of activated C3-positive patients
	also displayed MAC-associated C9 deposition. Deposition of complement
	factors was predominantly seen around hepatocytes with macrovesicular

	CONCLUSION: There is widespread activation of the complement system

  volume = {55},
  pages = {656-77},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {A major limitation of current comparative modeling methods is the
	accuracy with which regions that are structurally divergent from
	homologues of known structure can be modeled. Because structural
	differences between homologous proteins are responsible for variations
	in protein function and specificity, the ability to model these differences
	has important functional consequences. Although existing methods
	can provide reasonably accurate models of short loop regions, modeling
	longer structurally divergent regions is an unsolved problem. Here
	we describe a method based on the de novo structure prediction algorithm,
	Rosetta, for predicting conformations of structurally divergent regions
	in comparative models. Initial conformations for short segments are
	selected from the protein structure database, whereas longer segments
	are built up by using three- and nine-residue fragments drawn from
	the database and combined by using the Rosetta algorithm. A gap closure
	term in the potential in combination with modified Newton's method
	for gradient descent minimization is used to ensure continuity of
	the peptide backbone. Conformations of variable regions are refined
	in the context of a fixed template structure using Monte Carlo minimization
	together with rapid repacking of side-chains to iteratively optimize
	backbone torsion angles and side-chain rotamers. For short loops,
	mean accuracies of 0.69, 1.45, and 3.62 A are obtained for 4, 8,
	and 12 residue loops, respectively. In addition, the method can provide
	reasonable models of conformations of longer protein segments: predicted
	conformations of 3A root-mean-square deviation or better were obtained
	for 5 of 10 examples of segments ranging from 13 to 34 residues.
	In combination with a sequence alignment algorithm, this method generates
	complete, ungapped models of protein structures, including regions
	both similar to and divergent from a homologous structure. This combined
	method was used to make predictions for 28 protein domains in the
	Critical Assessment of Protein Structure 4 (CASP 4) and 59 domains
	in CASP 5, where the method ranked highly among comparative modeling
	and fold recognition methods. Model accuracy in these blind predictions
	is dominated by alignment quality, but in the context of accurate
	alignments, long protein segments can be accurately modeled. Notably,
	the method correctly predicted the local structure of a 39-residue
	insertion into a TIM barrel in CASP 5 target T0186.},

	advancing the application of direct borohydride fuel cells. In this
	study, we apply electronic structure calculations to elucidate the
	mechanism of borohydride oxidation over the Au(111) surface. Reaction
	free energies computed as a function of electrode potential are used
	to identify stable surface bound intermediates and likely rate-limiting
	steps. The results suggest that the weak adsorption of BH4- over
	Au(111) may limit the coverage of reactive intermediates at low overpotentials.
	Breaking O-H bonds on the Au(111) surface is highly endothermic and
	occurs over substantial reaction barriers at low overpotentials,
	leading to stable B(OH)(2)(*) and BOOH* species on the surface. B-O
	bond formation on the Au(111) surface is facile. B-H bond cleavage
	has a relatively low barrier, suggesting that Au(111) is effective
	in breaking B-H bonds. These results indicate that effective anode
	catalysts with stronger BH4- adsorption and greater activity for
	O-H dissociation compared to gold are necessary for improving the

  abstract = {Since the pioneering work of Plaxco, Simons, and Baker, it is now
	well known that the rates of protein folding strongly correlate with
	the average sequence separation (absolute contact order (ACO)) of
	native contacts. In spite of multitude of papers, our understanding
	to the basis of the relation between folding speed and ACO is still
	lacking. We model the transition state as a Gaussian polymer chain
	decorated with weak springs between native contacts while the unfolded
	state is modeled as a Gaussian chain only. Using these hamiltonians,
	our perturbative calculation explicitly shows folding speed and ACO
	are linearly related when only the first order term in the series
	is considered. However, to the second order, we notice the existence
	of two new topological metrics, termed COC(1) and COC(2) (COC stands
	for contact order correction). These additional correction terms
	are needed to properly account for the entropy loss due to overlapping
	(nested or linked) loops that are not well described by simple addition
	of entropies in ACO. COC(1) and COC(2) are related to fluctuations
	and correlations among different sequence separations. The new metric
	combining ACO, COC(1), and COC(2) improves folding speed dependence
	on native topology when applied to three different databases: (i)
	two-state proteins with only ??? and ? proteins, (ii) two-state proteins
	(???, ? and purely helical proteins all combined), and (iii) master
	set (multi-state and two-state) folding proteins. Furthermore, the
	first principle calculation provides us direct physical insights
	to the meaning of the fit parameters. The coefficient of ACO, for
	example, is related to the average strength of the contacts, while
	the constant term is related to the protein folding speed limit.
	With the new scaling law, our estimate of the folding speed limit
	is in close agreement with the widely accepted value of 1 ?s observed
	in proteins and RNA. Analyzing an exhaustive set (7367) of monomeric
	proteins from protein data bank, we find our new topology based metric
	(combining ACO, COC(1), and COC(2)) scales as N(0.54), N being the
	number of amino acids in a protein. This is in remarkable agreement
	with a previous argument based on random systems that predict protein
	folding speed depends on exp?(- N(0.5)). The first principle calculation
	presented here provides deeper insights to the role of topology in
	protein folding and unifies many parallel arguments, seemingly disconnected,
	demonstrating the existence of universal mechanism in protein folding
	kinetics that can be understood from simple polymer physics based
	principles.},

	C3, like human C3 its mechanism of binding to non-human primate C3
	was biphasic and did not follow a simple 1:1 interaction, suggesting

	activity. Analysis of Ala substitution analogs of Compstatin for

	a result of sterically hindered access to the binding pocket due

  abstract = {The number of all possible conformations of a polypeptide chain is
	too large to be sampled exhaustively. Nevertheless, protein sequences
	do fold into unique native states in seconds (the Levinthal paradox).
	To determine how the Levinthal paradox is resolved, we use a lattice
	Monte Carlo model in which the global minimum (native state) is known.
	The necessary and sufficient condition for folding in this model
	is that the native state be a pronounced global minimum on the potential
	surface. This guarantees thermodynamic stability of the native state
	at a temperature where the chain does not get trapped in local minima.
	Folding starts by a rapid collapse from a random-coil state to a
	random semi-compact globule. It then proceeds by a slow, rate-determining
	search through the semi-compact states to find a transition state
	from which the chain folds rapidly to the native state. The elements
	of the folding mechanism that lead to the resolution of the Levinthal
	paradox are the reduced number of conformations that need to be searched
	in the semi-compact globule (approximately 10(10) versus approximately
	10(16) for the random coil) and the existence of many (approximately
	10(3)) transition states. The results have evolutionary implications

	The necessary and sufficient condition for a sequence to fold rapidly

	the kinetic requirements for folding; i.e. the native state predominates

	to be kinetically possible. The applicability of the present results

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Currently, there exists tens of different microbial
	and eukaryotic metabolic reconstructions (e.g., Escherichia coli,
	Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis) with many more under
	development. All of these reconstructions are inherently incomplete
	with some functionalities missing due to the lack of experimental
	and/or homology information. A key challenge in the automated generation
	of genome-scale reconstructions is the elucidation of these gaps
	and the subsequent generation of hypotheses to bridge them. RESULTS:
	In this work, an optimization based procedure is proposed to identify
	and eliminate network gaps in these reconstructions. First we identify
	the metabolites in the metabolic network reconstruction which cannot
	be produced under any uptake conditions and subsequently we identify
	the reactions from a customized multi-organism database that restores
	the connectivity of these metabolites to the parent network using
	four mechanisms. This connectivity restoration is hypothesized to
	take place through four mechanisms: a) reversing the directionality
	of one or more reactions in the existing model, b) adding reaction
	from another organism to provide functionality absent in the existing
	model, c) adding external transport mechanisms to allow for importation
	of metabolites in the existing model and d) restore flow by adding
	intracellular transport reactions in multi compartment models. We
	demonstrate this procedure for the genome- scale reconstruction of
	Escherichia coli and also Saccharomyces cerevisiae wherein compartmentalization
	of intra-cellular reactions results in a more complex topology of
	the metabolic network. We determine that about 10% of metabolites
	in E. coli and 30% of metabolites in S. cerevisiae cannot carry any
	flux. Interestingly, the dominant flow restoration mechanism is directionality
	reversals of existing reactions in the respective models. CONCLUSION:
	We have proposed systematic methods to identify and fill gaps in
	genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. The identified gaps can be
	filled both by making modifications in the existing model and by
	adding missing reactions by reconciling multi-organism databases
	of reactions with existing genome-scale models. Computational results
	provide a list of hypotheses to be queried further and tested experimentally.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Complex carbohydrate structures, glycans, are essential
	components of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans. While
	individual glycan structures including the SSEA and Tra antigens
	are already used to define undifferentiated human embryonic stem
	cells (hESC), the whole spectrum of stem cell glycans has remained
	unknown. We undertook a global study of the asparagine-linked glycoprotein
	glycans (N-glycans) of hESC and their differentiated progeny using
	MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric and NMR spectroscopic profiling. Structural
	analyses were performed by specific glycosidase enzymes and mass
	spectrometric fragmentation analyses.RESULTS:The data demonstrated
	that hESC have a characteristic N-glycome which consists of both
	a constant part and a variable part that changes during hESC differentiation.
	hESC-associated N-glycans were downregulated and new structures emerged
	in the differentiated cells. Previously mouse embryonic stem cells
	have been associated with complex fucosylation by use of SSEA-1 antibody.
	In the present study we found that complex fucosylation was the most
	characteristic glycosylation feature also in undifferentiated hESC.
	The most abundant complex fucosylated structures were Lex and H type
	2 antennae in sialylated complex-type N-glycans.CONCLUSION:The N-glycan
	phenotype of hESC was shown to reflect their differentiation stage.
	During differentiation, hESC-associated N-glycan features were replaced
	by differentiated cell-associated structures. The results indicated
	that hESC differentiation stage can be determined by direct analysis
	of the N-glycan profile. These results provide the first overview
	of the N-glycan profile of hESC and form the basis for future strategies
	to target stem cell glycans.}

	this, we have used a variety of structural and evolutionary features
	to create simple deleterious mutation models that have been tested
	on both experimental mutagenesis and human allele data. We find that
	the most accurate predictions are obtained using a solvent-accessibility
	term, the C(beta) density, and a score derived from homologous sequences,
	SIFT. A classification tree using these two features has a cross-validated
	prediction error of 20.5% on an experimental mutagenesis test set
	when the prior probability for deleterious and neutral cases is equal,
	whereas this prediction error is 28.8% and 22.2% using either the
	C(beta) density or SIFT alone. The improvement imparted by structure
	increases when fewer homologs are available: when restricted to three
	homologs the prediction error improves from 26.9% using SIFT alone
	to 22.4% using SIFT and the C(beta) density, or 24.8% using SIFT
	and a noisy C(beta) density term approximating the inaccuracy of
	ab initio structures modeled by the Rosetta method. We conclude that
	methods for deleterious mutation prediction should include structural
	information when fewer than five to ten homologs are available, and
	that ab initio predicted structures may soon be useful in such cases
	when high-resolution structures are unavailable.},

	a 6-month, open, uncontrolled pilot study on 18 patients (14 females
	and 4 males, mean age 62 yrs.) with RA who had previously received
	DMARDs (mean 2.6) and discontinued the treatment at least one month
	earlier because lack of efficacy or severe side effects. Patients
	were treated with CM at the dose of 500 mg twice per day for the
	first 10 days, followed by a daily maintenance dose of 250 mg twice
	per day. RESULTS: 4/18 patients did not complete the treatment, 2/18
	were not responsive to the treatment and 2/18 discontinued the treatment.
	Following ACR criteria the improvement was: 10 patients ACR 20; 6
	patients ACR 50; and 2 patients ACR 70. The remaining 4 patients
	did not reach ACR 20 since either the number of tender or swollen
	joints was not to the level required. Reductions in PGE2 and soluble
	phospholipase A2 plasma levels were closely related to CM plasma
	levels. CONCLUSIONS: Ourfindings suggest that CM treatment can be
	beneficial in those patients who are not responsive to or cannot
	tolerate DMARDs. No definitive conclusions can be drawn based on
	the present study, due to the small sample size involved.},

  abstract = {The reaction catalyzed by Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase
	(ecDHFR) cycles through five detectable kinetic intermediates: holoenzyme,
	Michaelis complex, ternary product complex, tetrahydrofolate (THF)
	binary complex, and THF.NADPH complex. Isomorphous crystal structures
	analogous to these five intermediates and to the transition state
	(as represented by the methotrexate-NADPH complex) have been used
	to assemble a 2.1 A resolution movie depicting loop and subdomain
	movements during the catalytic cycle (see Supporting Information).
	The structures suggest that the M20 loop is predominantly closed
	over the reactants in the holoenzyme, Michaelis, and transition state
	complexes. But, during the remainder of the cycle, when nicotinamide
	is not bound, the loop occludes (protrudes into) the nicotinamide-ribose
	binding pocket. Upon changing from the closed to the occluded conformation,
	the central portion of the loop rearranges from beta-sheet to 3(10)
	helix. The change may occur by way of an irregularly structured open
	loop conformation, which could transiently admit a water molecule
	into position to protonate N5 of dihydrofolate. From the Michaelis
	to the transition state analogue complex, rotation between two halves
	of ecDHFR, the adenosine binding subdomain and loop subdomain, closes
	the (p-aminobenzoyl)glutamate (pABG) binding crevice by approximately
	0.5 A. Resulting enhancement of contacts with the pABG moiety may
	stabilize puckering at C6 of the pteridine ring in the transition
	state. The subdomain rotation is further adjusted by cofactor-induced
	movements (approximately 0.5 A) of helices B and C, producing a larger
	pABG cleft in the THF.NADPH analogue complex than in the THF analogue
	complex. Such movements may explain how THF release is assisted by
	NADPH binding. Subdomain rotation is not observed in vertebrate DHFR
	structures, but an analogous loop movement (residues 59-70) appears
	to similarly adjust the pABG cleft width, suggesting that these movements
	are important for catalysis. Loop movement, also unobserved in vertebrate
	DHFR structures, may preferentially weaken NADP+ vs NADPH binding
	in ecDHFR, an evolutionary adaptation to reduce product inhibition
	in the NADP+ rich environment of prokaryotes.},

	1.1.1.213, AKR1C9) is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily
	which inactivates circulating steroid hormones. We have proposed
	a catalytic mechanism in which Tyr 55 acts as a general acid with
	its pK value being lowered by a hydrogen bond with Lys 84 which is
	salt-linked to Asp 50. To test this mechanism, residues at the active
	site were mutated and the mutant enzymes (Y55F, Y55S, K84M, K84R,
	D50N, D50E, and H117A) were purified to homogeneity from an Escherichia
	coli expression system. Spectrophotometric assays showed that mutations
	of Tyr 55 and Lys 84 gave enzymes that were apparently inactive for
	steroid oxidation and reduction. All mutants appeared inactive for
	steroid reduction. The catalytic efficiencies for steroid oxidation
	were reduced 4-10-fold for the Asp 50 mutants and 300-fold for the
	H117A mutant. Fluorescence titration with NADPH demonstrated that
	each mutant bound cofactor unimpeded. Equilibrium dialysis indicated
	that the competitive inhibitor testosterone formed E.NADH.testosterone
	complexes only with the Y55F, Y55S, and D50N mutants with Kd values
	10-fold greater than those for wild-type. Therefore the loss of steroid
	oxidoreductase activity observed for the Tyr 55 mutants cannot be
	attributed simply to an inability to bind steroid. Using a highly
	sensitive radiometric assay in which the conversion of [14C]-5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone
	(DHT) to [14C]-3 alpha-androstanediol (3 alpha-Diol) was measured,
	the rate enhancement (kcat/knoncat) for the reaction was estimated
	to be 2.6 x 10(9). Using this assay, all mutants formed steroid product
	with decreases in an overall rate enhancement of 10(1)-10(4). It
	was found that Tyr 55 made the single largest contribution to rate
	enhancement. This is the first instance where point mutations in
	the conserved catalytic tetrad of an AKR yielded enzymes which were
	still catalytically active. This enabled the construction of pH vs
	kcat profiles for the reduction of [14C]-5 alpha-DHT catalyzed by
	the tetrad mutants. These profiles revealed that the titratable group
	assigned to the general acid (pK = 6.50 +/- 0.42) was eliminated
	in the Y55F and H117A mutants. The pH-independent value of kcat was
	decreased in the H117A and Y55F mutants, by 2 and 4 log units, respectively.
	pH vs kcat(app) profiles for the oxidation of [3H]-3 alpha-Diol showed
	that the same titratable group (pK = 7.50 +/- 0.30) was eliminated
	in both the Y55F and K84M mutants but was retained in the H117A mutant.
	Since only the Y55F mutant eliminated the titratable group in both
	the reduction and oxidation directions it is assigned as the catalytic
	general acid/base. The differential effects of His 117 and Lys 84
	on the ionization of Tyr 55 are explained by a "push-pull" mechanism
	in which His 117 facilitates proton donation and Lys 84 facilitates
	proton removal by Tyr 55.},

	where each of them came under the control of a strong tac promoter.
	This was designed to achieve equal over-expression of both genes

	in vivo of heterodimers, carrying one crippled and one fully functional
	active site, was detected by absorbance spectroscopy and fluorescence
	emission spectrometry of enzyme-bound FAD and by active site complementation.
	The fractional distribution of homo- and hetero-dimers was in accord
	with that expected for a random association of enzyme subunits. In
	a homo-dimer, the H439Q mutation leads to a big fall in the value

	and co-factors in an enzymatic reaction) and an MM treatment for
	the surroundings (e.g., protein and solvent). The resulting schemes

	infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
	(XPS). The N 1s line in XPS spectra showed deprotonation of the amine
	group of PMG (NH2+) with increasing pH. IR analyses showed no evidence
	for the interaction of PMG's carboxylate group with the goethite
	surface, while the phosphonate group formed inner-sphere complexes.
	There is evidence for intramolecular hydrogen bonding between NH2+
	and both the carboxylate and the phosphonate groups at low pH. Intramolecular
	hydrogen bonding is lost when the amine group is deprotonated, and
	the trend in intramolecular hydrogen bonding between NH2+ and phosphonate
	shows that PMG adsorbs via predominantly monodentate complexation.
	A minor quantity of bidentate complexes is thought to form both at
	near-neutral pH and when the surface concentration of PMG is low.
	While the phosphonate group of PMG binds directly, the carboxylate
	group remains relatively "free" from complexation with goethite,

	binding specificity towards one of its natural targets, smooth muscle
	myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK). The optimization was performed
	using optimization of rotamers by iterative techniques (ORBIT), a
	protein design program that utilizes a physically based force-field
	and the Dead-End Elimination theorem to compute sequences that are
	optimal for a given protein scaffold. Starting from the structure
	of the CaM-smMLCK complex, the program considered 10(22) amino acid
	residue sequences to obtain the lowest-energy CaM sequence. The resulting
	eightfold mutant, CaM_8, was constructed and tested for binding to
	a set of seven CaM target peptides. CaM_8 displayed high binding
	affinity to the smMLCK peptide (1.3nM), similar to that of the wild-type
	protein (1.8nM). The affinity of CaM_8 to six other target peptides
	was reduced, as intended, by 1.5-fold to 86-fold. Hence, CaM_8 exhibited
	increased binding specificity, preferring the smMLCK peptide to the
	other targets. Studies of this type may increase our understanding
	of the origins of binding specificity in protein-ligand complexes
	and may provide valuable information that can be used in the design
	of novel protein receptors and/or ligands.},

	a model for simulating the transport of CO2 and tracers in the ocean
	(HILDA, for High-Latitude Exchange/Interior Diffusion-Advection Model)
	that combines features of box models and of the box-diffusion model.
	It is latitudinally divided into two zones; in the low latitudes,
	transport into the deep ocean occurs by eddy diffusion, while the
	high-latitude zone consists of two boxes (surface and deep ocean).
	We compare different ways of calibration and find that in order to
	reproduce the distributions of natural 14C as well as of bomb-produced
	14C, the vertical eddy diffusivity K must decrease with depth. The
	concept of eddy diffusion is discussed by calculating apparent eddy
	diffusivities from 3-D model tracer simulations. The depth dependence
	of K is qualitatively confirmed by these calculations, reflecting
	the fact that the water circulation is more vigorous near the surface
	than at depth. We find that eddy diffusivities derived from 14C are
	not appropriate for representing the large-scale vertical temperature
	distribution, because the latitudinal distribution of temperature
	differs in a systematic way from that of 14C and also of anthropogenic
	CO2. Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2, biospheric CO2 emissions
	and isotopic perturbations are calculated, based on the observed
	atmospheric CO2concentration history. The results indicate an oceanic
	uptake of 1.9 Gt C yr?1 in 1980 and a near-zero net contribution
	from the biota in the past several decades. The HILDA model is compared
	with other models, and we find that its response to atmospheric CO2
	perturbations is rather similar to that of a 3-D ocean carbon cycle
	model of Sarmiento etÂ al. (1992).}

	+/- 0.006, and 1.051 +/- 0.002, respectively. The large 1'-(3)H and
	small 1'-(14)C KIEs indicate that the Escherichia coli MTAN reaction
	undergoes a dissociative (D(N)A(N)) (S(N)1) mechanism with little
	involvement of the leaving group or participation of the attacking
	nucleophile at the transition state, causing the transition state
	to have significant ribooxacarbenium ion character. A transition
	state constrained to match the intrinsic KIEs was located with density
	functional theory [B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)]. The leaving group (N9) is predicted
	to be 3.0 A from the anomeric carbon. The small beta-secondary 2'-(3)H
	KIE of 1.044 corresponds to a modest 3'-endo conformation for ribose
	and a H1'-C1'-C2'-H2' dihedral angle of 53 degrees at the transition
	state. Natural bond orbital analysis of the substrate and the transition
	state suggests that the 4'-(3)H KIE is due to hyperconjugation between
	the lone pair (n(p)) of O3' and the antibonding (sigma) orbital of
	the C4'-H4' group, and the methyl-(3)H(3) KIE is due to hyperconjugation
	between the n(p) of sulfur and the sigma of methyl C-H bonds. Transition
	state analogues that resemble this transition state structure are
	powerful inhibitors, and their molecular electrostatic potential
	maps closely resemble that of the transition state.},

	which combines various scoring functions designed to match structurally
	related target/template pairs. Each variant described was found to
	have a Z-score above which most identified templates have good structural
	(threading) alignments, Zstruct (Zgood). â€˜Easyâ€™ targets with
	accurate threading alignments are identified as single templates
	with Z > Zgood or two templates, each with Z > Zstruct, having a
	good consensus structure in mutually aligned regions. â€˜Mediumâ€™
	targets have a pair of templates lacking a consensus structure, or
	a single template for which Zstruct < Z < Zgood. PROSPECTOR_3 was
	applied to a comprehensive Protein Data Bank (PDB) benchmark composed
	of 1491 single domain proteins, 41â€“200 residues long and no more
	than 30% identical to any threading template. Of the proteins, 878
	were found to be easy targets, with 761 having a root mean square
	deviation (RMSD) from native of less than 6.5 Ã…. The average contact
	prediction accuracy was 46%, and on average 17.6 residue continuous
	fragments were predicted with RMSD values of 2.0 Ã…. There were 606
	medium targets identified, 87% (31%) of which had good structural
	(threading) alignments. On average, 9.1 residue, continuous fragments
	with RMSD of 2.5 Ã… were predicted. Combining easy and medium sets,
	63% (91%) of the targets had good threading (structural) alignments
	compared to native; the average target/template sequence identity
	was 22%. Only nine targets lacked matched templates. Moreover, PROSPECTOR_3
	consistently outperforms PSIBLAST. Similar results were predicted

	a rod to coccobacillus, and undergoes extensive cytoplasmic membrane
	invagination when it switches from aerobic to photoheterotrophic
	growth. The role of MreB in defining R. sphaeroides shape was therefore
	investigated. Attempts at deleting or insertionally inactivating
	mreB were unsuccessful under all growth conditions. Immunofluorescence
	microscopy showed MreB localized to mid-cell in elongating cells
	under both aerobic and photoheterotrophic conditions. Three-dimensional
	reconstruction showed that MreB formed a ring at mid-cell. MreB remained
	at mid-cell as septation began but localized to new sites in the
	daughter cells before the completion of septation. MreB localized
	to putative septation sites in cephalexin-treated filamentous cells.
	Genomic single-copy mreB was replaced with gfp-mreB, and green fluorescent
	protein (GFP)-MreB localized in the same pattern, as seen with immunofluorescence
	microscopy. Some of the cells expressing GFP-MreB were abnormal,
	principally displaying an increase in cell width, suggesting that
	the fusion was not fully functional in all cells. GFP-MreB localized
	to swellings at mid-cell in cells treated with the penicillin-binding
	protein 2 inhibitor amdinocillin. These data suggest that MreB is
	essential in R. sphaeroides, performing a role at mid-cell in elongating
	cells, and in early septation, putatively in the cytoplasmic control

	and hydrolysis of mis-acylated Ser- and Gly-tRNA(Ala) at 2 different
	catalytic sites. Here, we describe the monomer structures of C-terminal
	truncated archaeal AlaRS, with both activation and editing domains
	in the apo form, in complex with an Ala-AMP analog, and in a high-resolution
	lysine-methylated form. The structures show docking of the editing
	domain to the activation domain opposite from the predicted tRNA-binding
	surface. Thus, the editing site is positioned >35 A from the activation
	site, prompting us to model 2 different tRNA complexes: one binding
	tRNA at the activation site, and the other binding tRNA at the editing
	site. Interestingly, a gel-shift assay also implies the presence
	of 2 types of tRNA complex with different mobility. These results
	suggest that tRNA translocation via a canonical CCA flipping is unlikely
	to occur in AlaRS. The structure also demonstrated the binding of
	zinc in the editing site, in which the specific coordination of zinc
	would be facilitated by a conserved GGQ motif, implying that the
	editing mechanism may not be the same as in ThrRS. As Asn-194 in
	eubacterial AlaRS important for Ser misactivation is replaced by
	Thr-213 in archaeal AlaRS, a different Ser accommodation mechanism
	is proposed.},

	after reduction of its three cysteine disulphide linkages can occur
	when the reduced protein is placed in a suitable oxidizing medium

	by trapping chemically intermediates which contain only one or two
	disulphide bonds (ref. 1 and refs therein). We report here that during
	structural studies of these intermediates by NMR, we have found that
	complete re-oxidation of the protein results in substantial quantities
	of a metastable folded species which is identical to native BPTI
	in its covalent bonding (including the disulphide bonds) but possesses
	a somewhat different conformation. The existence of such a species
	is supported by circular dichroism measurements on refolded BPTI.
	This novel form of BPTI is of considerable interest because it can
	be used to provide information about the folding mechanism and conformational
	stability of the protein.},

	through measurements of the mineralized fraction (14CO2), soil water
	fraction, KOH extractable fraction, and non-extractable fraction.
	Microbial parameters used to characterize the soils were estimates
	of size of microbial biomass, overall microbial activity and microbial

	of glyphosate mineralization. The constant thawed treatment and the
	treatments with fluctuating temperature exhibited significantly increased

	clustering method to identify the structures of a protein, in a given
	ensemble, which are closest to the native structure. The method consists
	of an iterative procedure, which aims at eliminating clusters of
	structures at each iteration, which are unlikely to be of similar

	decoys; 2), medium-to-low resolution decoys from Decoys 'R' Us; 3),
	medium-to-low resolution decoys from the first-principles approach,
	ASTRO-FOLD; and 4), selected targets from CASP8. The extensive tests
	demonstrate that ICON can identify high-quality structures in each

	biology has been accompanied by a proliferation of software tools,
	data formats, analytical techniques and web servers. This brings
	with it the challenge of integrating phylogenetic and other related
	biological data found in a wide variety of formats, and underlines
	the need for reusable software that can read, manipulate and transform
	this information into the various forms required to build computational
	pipelines. RESULTS: We built a Python software library for working
	with phylogenetic data that is tightly integrated with Biopython,
	a broad-ranging toolkit for computational biology. Our library, Bio.Phylo,
	is highly interoperable with existing libraries, tools and standards,
	and is capable of parsing common file formats for phylogenetic trees,
	performing basic transformations and manipulations, attaching rich
	annotations, and visualizing trees. We unified the modules for working
	with the standard file formats Newick, NEXUS and phyloXML behind
	a consistent and simple API, providing a common set of functionality
	independent of the data source. CONCLUSIONS: Bio.Phylo meets a growing
	need in bioinformatics for working with heterogeneous types of phylogenetic
	data. By supporting interoperability with multiple file formats and
	leveraging existing Biopython features, this library simplifies the
	construction of phylogenetic workflows. We also provide examples
	of the benefits of building a community around a shared open-source
	project. Bio.Phylo is included with Biopython, available through
	the Biopython website, http://biopython.org.},

	and the binding affinity of the purified ligand-binding domain for

	Glycosylation is the most structurally elaborate and diverse type

	that other regions must undergo structural rearrangements of the

	in such specificity could be those located in regions where interaction
	with the pyrophosphate group of the coenzyme takes place, namely
	loops 155-160 and 261-268 in Anabaena FNR. In order to learn more
	about the coenzyme specificity determinants, and to better define
	the structural basis of coenzyme binding, mutations in the pyrophosphate
	and 2'-P binding regions of FNR have been introduced. Modification
	of the pyrophosphate binding region, involving residues Thr-155,
	Ala-160, and Leu-263, indicates that this region is involved in determining
	coenzyme specificity and that selected alterations of these positions
	produce FNR enzymes that are able to bind NAD+. Thus, our results
	suggest that slightly different structural rearrangements of the
	backbone chain in the pyrophosphate binding region might determine
	FNR specificity for the coenzyme. Combined mutations at the 2'-P
	binding region, involving residues Ser-223, Arg-224, Arg-233, and
	Tyr-235, in combination with the residues mentioned above in the
	pyrophosphate binding region have also been carried out in an attempt
	to increase the FNR affinity for NAD+/H. However, in most cases the
	analyzed mutants lost the ability for NADP+/H binding and electron
	transfer, and no major improvements were observed with regard to
	the efficiency of the reactions with NAD+/H. Therefore, our results
	confirm that determinants for coenzyme specificity in FNR are also
	situated in the pyrophosphate binding region and not only in the
	2'-P binding region. Such observations also suggest that other regions

	to receive widespread attention and may be significant due to their

	also known as rolling-circle transposons, are a distinctive subclass
	of TE with a unique transposition mechanism. Here, we describe the
	first evidence for the repeated HT of four different families of
	Helitrons in an unprecedented array of organisms, including mammals,
	reptiles, fish, invertebrates, and insect viruses. The Helitrons
	present in these species have a patchy distribution and are closely
	related (80Ã¢â‚¬â€œ98% sequence identity), despite the deep divergence
	times among hosts. Multiple lines of evidence indicate the extreme
	conservation of sequence identity is not due to selection, including
	the highly fragmented nature of the Helitrons identified and the
	lack of any signatures of selection at the nucleotide level. The
	presence of horizontally transferred Helitrons in insect viruses,
	in particular, suggests that this may represent a potential mechanism
	of transfer in some taxa. Unlike genes, Helitrons that have horizontally
	transferred into new host genomes can amplify, in some cases reaching
	up to several hundred copies and representing a substantial fraction
	of the genome. Because Helitrons are known to frequently capture
	and amplify gene fragments, HT of this unique group of DNA transposons
	could lead to horizontal gene transfer and incur dramatic shifts
	in the trajectory of genome evolution.}

	its 'surface finish' and to prevent a subsequently deposited microporous
	overlayer from penetrating into the support. Second, membranes are

  abstract = {An approach to loop prediction that starts with a database search
	is presented and analyzed. To obtain meaningful statistics, 130 loops
	from 21 proteins were studied. The correlation between the internal
	conformation of the loop and the conformation of the neighboring
	stem residues was examined. Distances between C(alpha) and C(beta)
	of the immediate neighbor residues at each end select template loops
	as well as more complex (e.g. three residues on either side) matching
	criteria. To have a high probability that the best possible loop
	candidate in the database is included in the set, relatively large
	cutoffs for matching the interatomic distances of the stem residues
	have to be used in the template loop selection procedure; for loops
	of length 5, this results in an average of 1000 loops and for loops
	of length 9, the number is about 1500. The required number increases
	only slowly with loop length, in contrast to the exponential time
	increase involved in direct searches of the conformational space.
	The best loops among the large number of candidates can be determined
	by ranking them with the standard CHARMM non-bonded energy function
	(without electrostatics) applied to the backbone and C(beta) atoms.
	The same representation (backbone plus C(beta)) can be used to optimize
	the loop orientations relative to the rest of the protein by constrained
	energy minimization. Target loops that have many non-bonded contacts
	with the protein yield better results so that analysis of the non-bonded
	contacts of the selected template loops is useful in determining
	the expected accuracy of a prediction. The method for loop selection
	and optimization predicted eight (out of 18) loops of up to nine
	residues to an RMSD better than 1.07 A relative to the crystal structure;
	for 17 of the 18 loops, one of the three lowest energy template loops
	had an RMSD of less than 1.79 A. The prediction of antibody loops
	from a database search is more effective than that for non-antibody
	loops. Provided that they belong to one of the canonical classes,
	very similar antibody loops are certain to exist in the database.
	Superposition of the stem residues for antibody loops also results
	in a better orientation than with arbitrary target loops because
	the neighboring residues tend to have a more similar beta-strand
	structure. Two H3 loops (for which no canonical structures have been
	proposed) were predicted with reasonable accuracy (RMSD of 0.49 A
	and 1.07 A) even though no corresponding antibody loops were in the

	functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates
	both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and
	partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is
	encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared
	to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement
	of 0.26 Ã…, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field
	(0.25 Ã…) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44
	Ã…, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed
	on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular
	energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements
	and relative energies were 0.25 Ã… and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively.
	These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Ã… and
	1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base
	pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational
	pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The
	RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about
	0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an

	In this study, dihydrofolate reductase, a small monomeric protein

	to address this question. Experimental and computational studies
	have proposed a dynamic network that includes two residues remote
	from the active site (G121 and M42). The current study compares the
	nature of the H-transfer step of the WT enzyme, two single mutants,
	and their double mutant. The contribution of quantum mechanical tunneling
	and enzyme dynamics to the H-transfer step was examined by determining
	intrinsic kinetic isotope effects, their temperature dependence,
	and activation parameters. Different patterns of environmentally
	coupled tunneling were found for these four enzymes. The findings
	indicate that the naturally evolved WT dihydrofolate reductase requires
	no donor-acceptor distance fluctuations (no gating). Both single
	mutations affect the rearrangement of the system before tunneling,
	so some gating is required, but the overall nature of the environmentally
	coupled tunneling appears similar to that of the WT enzyme. The double
	mutation, on the other hand, seems to cause a major change in the
	nature of H transfer, leading to poor reorganization and substantial
	gating. These findings support the suggestion that these distal residues
	synergistically affect the H transfer at the active site of the enzyme.
	This observation is in accordance with the notion that these remote
	residues are part of a dynamic network that is coupled to the catalyzed
	chemistry.},

	PLP, PMF, and LUDI), four scoring functions implemented in the CScore
	module in SYBYL (F-Score, G-Score, D-Score, and ChemScore), the scoring
	function implemented in the AutoDock program, and two stand-alone
	scoring functions (DrugScore and X-Score). These scoring functions
	are not tested in the context of a particular docking program. Instead,
	conformational sampling and scoring are separated into two consecutive
	steps. First, an exhaustive conformational sampling is performed
	by using the AutoDock program to generate an ensemble of docked conformations
	for each ligand molecule. This conformational ensemble is required
	to cover the entire conformational space as much as possible rather
	than to focus on a few energy minima. Then, each scoring function
	is applied to score this conformational ensemble to see if it can
	identify the experimentally observed conformation from all of the
	other decoys. Among all of the scoring functions under test, six
	of them, i.e., PLP, F-Score, LigScore, DrugScore, LUDI, and X-Score,
	yield success rates higher than the AutoDock scoring function. The
	success rates of these six scoring functions range from 66% to 76%

	Combining any two or three of these six scoring functions into a

	and computer simulations allows one to exclude many of the popular

	approaches used by organic chemists to catalyze reactions in solutions
	are not used by enzymes. This point is illustrated by considering
	the desolvation hypothesis and showing that it cannot account for
	a large increase in kcat relative to the corresponding kcage for
	the reference reaction in a solvent cage. The problems associated

	the reorganization energy for stabilizing the relevant transition

	(2O*) states by facilitating electron donation to oxygen, causing
	a more exothermic reaction energy (-0.84 eV for Na and O-2, -0.81
	eV for isolated O-2) and a decrease in dissociation barrier (0.39
	eV for Na and O-2, 0.57 eV for isolated O-2). Solvation decreases
	the reaction energy (-0.67 eV) due to enhanced hydrogen bond stabilization
	of O-2* compared to 2O*. The influence of Na is less pronounced at
	the solvated interface (barrier decreases by only 0.11 eV) because
	H2O screens Na charge-donation. In the electrochemical model system,
	the dissociation energy becomes more exothermic and the barrier decreases
	toward more positive potentials. Potential-dependent behavior results
	from changes in interfacial dipole moment and polarizability between
	O-2*, the dissociation transition state, and 2O*; each are influenced
	by changes in adsorption and hydrogen bonding. Coadsorption of Na
	in the solvated system dampens the dipole moment change between O-2*
	and 2O* and significantly increases the polarizability at the dissociation
	transition state and for 2O*; the combination causes little change
	in the reaction energy but reduces the activation barrier by 0.08
	eV at 0 V versus NHE. The potential-dependent behavior contrasts
	that determined at a constant surface charge or from an applied electric
	field, illustrating the importance of considering the electrochemical
	potential at the fully-solvated interface in determining reaction
	energetics, even for non-redox reactions.},

	of coenzyme specificity from NAD(+) to NADP(+) and 2) thermostabilization
	by introducing an additional zinc atom. Site-directed mutagenesis
	was used to examine the roles of Asp(207), Ile(208), Phe(209), and
	Asn(211) in the discrimination between NAD(+) and NADP(+). Single
	mutants (D207A, I208R, F209S, and N211R) improved 5 approximately
	48-fold in catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) with NADP(+) compared
	with the wild type but retained substantial activity with NAD(+).
	The double mutants (D207A/I208R and D207A/F209S) improved by 3 orders
	of magnitude in k(cat)/K(m) with NADP(+), but they still preferred
	NAD(+) to NADP(+). The triple mutant (D207A/I208R/F209S) and quadruple

	values in k(cat)/K(m) with NADP(+) than the wild-type enzyme, reaching
	values comparable with k(cat)/K(m) with NAD(+) of the wild-type enzyme.
	Because most NADP(+)-dependent XDH mutants constructed in this study
	decreased the thermostability compared with the wild-type enzyme,
	we attempted to improve the thermostability of XDH mutants by the
	introduction of an additional zinc atom. The introduction of three
	cysteine residues in wild-type XDH gave an additional zinc-binding

	Dimerization involving specific B-chain interactions is observed

	The method is based on a procedure that generates a set of conformations,
	each with its own force-field energy, but adds a term to this energy
	that favors conformations that are close in structure (have a low
	rmsd) to other conformations. The sum of the force-field energy and
	rmsd-dependent term is defined here as the "colony energy" of a given
	conformation, because each conformation that is generated is viewed
	as representing a colony of points. The use of the colony energy
	tends to select conformations that are located in broad energy basins.
	The approach is applied to the ab initio prediction of the conformations
	of all of the loops in a dataset of 135 nonredundant proteins. By
	using an rmsd from a native criterion based on the superposition
	of loop stems, the average rmsd of 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8-residue long
	loops is 0.85, 0.92, 1.23, and 1.45 A, respectively. For 8-residue
	loops, 60 of 61 predictions have an rmsd of less than 3.0 A. The

  abstract = {Motivation: A number of studies of individual proteins have shown
	that post-translational modifications (PTMs) are associated with
	structural rearrangements of their target proteins. Although such
	studies provide critical insights into the mechanics behind the dynamic
	regulation of protein function, they usually feature examples with
	relatively large conformational changes. However, with the steady
	growth of Protein Data Bank (PDB) and available PTM sites, it is
	now possible to more systematically characterize the role of PTMs
	as conformational switches. In this study, we ask (1) what is the
	expected extent of structural change upon PTM, (2) how often are
	those changes in fact substantial, (3) whether the structural impact
	is spatially localized or global and (4) whether different PTMs have
	different signatures.Results: We exploit redundancy in PDB and, using
	root-mean-square deviation, study the conformational heterogeneity
	of groups of protein structures corresponding to identical sequences
	in their unmodified and modified forms. We primarily focus on the
	two most abundant PTMs in PDB, glycosylation and phosphorylation,
	but show that acetylation and methylation have similar tendencies.
	Our results provide evidence that PTMs induce conformational changes
	at both local and global level. However, the proportion of large
	changes is unexpectedly small; only 7% of glycosylated and 13% of
	phosphorylated proteins undergo global changes >2 Å. Further analysis
	suggests that phosphorylation stabilizes protein structure by reducing
	global conformational heterogeneity by 25%. Overall, these results
	suggest a subtle but common role of allostery in the mechanisms through
	which PTMs affect regulatory and signaling pathways.Contact: predrag@indiana.eduSupplementary

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel linear programming approach to do protein
	3-dimensional (3D) structure prediction via threading. Based on the
	contact map graph of the protein 3D structure template, the protein
	threading problem is formulated as a large scale integer programming
	(IP) problem. The IP formulation is then relaxed to a linear programming
	(LP) problem, and then solved by the canonical branch-and-bound method.
	The final solution is globally optimal with respect to energy functions.
	In particular, our energy function includes pairwise interaction
	preferences and allowing variable gaps which are two key factors
	in making the protein threading problem NP-hard. A surprising result
	is that, most of the time, the relaxed linear programs generate integral
	solutions directly. Our algorithm has been implemented as a software
	package RAPTOR-RApid Protein Threading by Operation Research technique.
	Large scale benchmark test for fold recognition shows that RAPTOR
	significantly outperforms other programs at the fold similarity level.
	The CAFASP3 evaluation, a blind and public test by the protein structure
	prediction community, ranks RAPTOR as top 1, among individual prediction
	servers, in terms of the recognition capability and alignment accuracy
	for Fold Recognition (FR) family targets. RAPTOR also performs very
	well in recognizing the hard Homology Modeling (HM) targets. RAPTOR
	was implemented at the University of Waterloo and it can be accessed
	at http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~j3xu/RAPTOR_form.htm.},

	can be derived either from physical principles (physical-based energy
	function) or statistical analysis of known protein structures (knowledge-based
	statistical potentials). It is commonly believed that statistical
	potentials are appropriate for coarse-grained representation of proteins
	but are not as accurate as physical-based potentials when atomic
	resolution is required. Several recent applications of physical-based
	energy functions to loop selections appear to support this view.
	In this article, we apply a recently developed DFIRE-based statistical
	potential to three different loop decoy sets (RAPPER, Jacobson, and
	Forrest-Woolf sets). Together with a rotamer library for side-chain
	optimization, the performance of DFIRE-based potential in the RAPPER
	decoy set (385 loop targets) is comparable to that of AMBER/GBSA
	for short loops (two to eight residues). The DFIRE is more accurate
	for longer loops (9 to 12 residues). Similar trend is observed when
	comparing DFIRE with another physical-based OPLS/SGB-NP energy function
	in the large Jacobson decoy set (788 loop targets). In the Forrest-Woolf
	decoy set for the loops of membrane proteins, the DFIRE potential
	performs substantially better than the combination of the CHARMM

	a single-term DFIRE-statistical energy function can provide an accurate

	fold, the nucleotide specificity of Vh-ALDH has been changed from
	NADP(+) to NAD(+). Replacement of Thr175 by a negatively charged
	residue (Asp or Glu) resulted in an increase in k(cat)/K(m) for NAD(+)
	relative to that for NADP(+) of up to 5000-fold due to a decrease
	for NAD(+) and an increase for NADP(+) in their respective Michaelis
	constants (K(a)). Differential protection by NAD(+) and NADP(+) against
	thermal inactivation and comparison of the dissociation constants
	of NMN, 2'-AMP, 2'5'-ADP, and 5'-AMP for these mutants and the wild-type
	enzyme clearly support the change in nucleotide specificity. Moreover,
	replacement of Thr175 with polar residues (N, S, or Q) demonstrated
	that a more efficient NAD(+)-dependent enzyme T175Q could be created

	Replacement with glutamic acid or glutamine strengthened interactions

  abstract = {Protein folding is regarded as a quantum transition between the torsion
	states of a polypeptide chain. According to the quantum theory of
	conformational dynamics, we propose the dynamical contact order (DCO)
	defined as a characteristic of the contact described by the moment
	of inertia and the torsion potential energy of the polypeptide chain
	between contact residues. Consequently, the protein folding rate
	can be quantitatively studied from the point of view of dynamics.
	By comparing theoretical calculations and experimental data on the
	folding rate of 80 proteins, we successfully validate the view that
	protein folding is a quantum conformational transition. We conclude
	that (i) a correlation between the protein folding rate and the contact
	inertial moment exists; (ii) multi-state protein folding can be regarded
	as a quantum conformational transition similar to that of two-state
	proteins but with an intermediate delay. We have estimated the order
	of magnitude of the time delay; (iii) folding can be classified into
	two types, exergonic and endergonic. Most of the two-state proteins
	with higher folding rate are exergonic and most of the multi-state
	proteins with low folding rate are endergonic. The folding speed
	limit is determined by exergonic folding.},

	For the binding of H(2)F to DHFR, the simplest mechanism consistent

	conformers. At pH 7.0, the binding reaction has a bimolecular rate

	exist. NADPH binds to a different conformer than H(2)F with a bimolecular
	rate constant of 2.6-5.7 x 10(6) M(-1).s(-1), with the former value

	associated with hydride transfer. The results from stopped-flow and

	to form right-handed helices. For each value of the bias parameter,
	100 trajectories of up to one microsecond are performed. Such statistically
	valid sampling of the kinetics is made possible by the use of the
	discrete molecular dynamics method with square-well interactions.
	This permits much faster simulations for off-lattice models than
	do continuous potentials. It is found that major folding pathways
	can be defined, although ensembles with considerable structural variation
	are involved. The large gap models generally fold faster than those
	with a smaller gap. For the large gap models, the kinetic intermediates
	are non-obligatory, while both obligatory and non-obligatory intermediates
	are present for small gap models. Certain large gap intermediates
	have a two-helix microdomain with one helix extended outward (as
	in domain-swapped dimers); the small gap intermediates have more
	diverse structures. The importance of studying the kinetic, as well
	as the thermodynamics, of folding for an understanding of the mechanism
	is discussed and the relation between kinetic and equilibrium intermediates
	is examined. It is found that the behavior of this model system has
	aspects that encompass both the "new" view and the "old" view of
	protein folding.},

  abstract = {The very high concentration of macromolecules within cells can potentially
	have an overwhelming effect on the thermodynamic activity of cellular
	components because of excluded volume effects. To estimate the magnitudes
	of such effects, we have made an experimental study of the cytoplasm
	of Escherichia coli. Parameters from cells and cell extracts are
	used to calculate approximate activity coefficients for cytoplasmic
	conditions. These calculations require a representation of the sizes,
	concentrations and effective specific volumes of the macromolecules
	in the extracts. Macromolecule size representations are obtained
	either by applying a two-phase distribution assay to define a related
	homogeneous solution or by using the molecular mass distribution
	of macromolecules from gel filtration. Macromolecule concentrations
	in cytoplasm are obtained from analyses of extracts by applying a
	correction for the dilution that occurs during extraction. That factor
	is determined from experiments based upon the known impermeability
	of the cytoplasmic volume to sucrose in intact E. coli. Macromolecule
	concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli in either exponential
	or stationary growth phase are estimated to be approximately 0.3
	to 0.4 g/ml. Macromolecule specific volumes are inferred from the
	composition of close-packed precipitates induced by polyethylene
	glycol. Several well-characterized proteins which bind to DNA (lac
	repressor, RNA polymerase) are extremely sensitive to changes in
	salt concentration in studies in vitro, but are insensitive in studies
	in vivo. Application of the activity coefficients from the present
	work indicates that at least part of this discrepancy arises from
	the difference in excluded volumes in these studies. Applications
	of the activity coefficients to solubility or to association reactions
	are also discussed, as are changes associated with cell growth phase
	and osmotic or other effects. The use of solutions of purified macromolecules

	- a), the density of entropy levels D(a), the dimensionless chemical
	potential alpha = mu/kT, etc. - The thermodynamics of the ideal gas
	is treated on the basis of entropy quanta by means of the density
	matrix formalism. In this way we obtain the total particle entropy
	A, the thermodynamic entropy S (equation of Sackur-Tetrode), the
	internal and the Helmholtz free energy E and F, respectively, etc.
	Moreover, it can also be shown on the basis of entropy quanta that
	the entropy of a closed system in thermal equilibrium has a maximum
	value, S = S-max. Against this, the entropy S' of an arbitrary non-equilibrium
	state is always smaller, S' < S-max (second law of thermodynamics).
	- Application of ordinary density matrix theory to a closed system
	of N particles leads to the result that the entropy S does not change
	in time, dS/dt = 0, regardless whether we consider an equilibrium
	state, S = S-max, or a non-equilibrium state. S = S'. Consequently,
	S cannot irreversibly change from S' to S-max. However. any irreversible
	process is accompanied by a positive entropy production P = dS/dt
	> 0. In order to overcome this obvious contradiction, we discuss
	the entropy evolution in time by means of the commutator equation
	G = i[P, t], which is deduced from very general assumptions. Here
	P and t are the operators of the entropy production P and the time
	t. Accordingly, P and t do not commute in general, and hence P and
	t are not sharply defined simultaneously. Instead we have uncertainties
	DeltaP and Deltat, which are expressed by the uncertainty relation
	of the N-particle system, DeltaPDeltat greater than or equal to (1
	/2)\(G)\ = (gamma/2)k. This P - t uncertainty relation easily allows
	a discussion of the evolution of the entropy S in time t from S'
	to S-max. Now the irreversible steps are correctly described by the
	entropy production P = dS/dt > 0. and the thermal equilibrium by
	P = 0, Delta P = 0, mid thus the lifetime Deltat = infinity.},
